We should chat.  Per the ISDA, ENA is the calc agent and we have already 
agreed to usual Market Disruption Events and fallbacks in the ISDA.  If you 
want to change the ISDA agreement, then we can consider the items which 
Merchant has included in the draft.

As calc agent, we should create a draft and send the form to you for review.  
However, I do need you to explain/verify Floating Price B.  And verify 
rounding convention which differs from our standard.

I have indicated the kinds of adjustments from the PJM platform necessary to make it work.  I don't think is necessary to take a swing at Mark Mayer of BPA to make our point that LMP will work.  Mark was caught flat footed and unprepared for Dick O'Niell's cheap shot.  Second, the proportion of hydro and the mix of other units is quite different in PJM and NYISO, so the fact that they fit hydro in around the edges is not necessarily proof that it will work in the PNW.  For that reason, I have noted the mix of units (hydro and base load) to show that the unit committment process will be different but you can still produce hourly prices.

You requested that I give you a list of things to avoid discussion with ABB.  We've maintained a reasonably open relationship with ABB up to this point, but here are some (fairly obvious) things that we should probably steer clear of:

1.  No discussion about Fronterra;
2.  No specifics about the DeAcero contract, e.g. extension date, CP's, etc; and
3.  No discussion about project credit issues or financing alternatives for the project.

When this ABB contingent was here last (Feb 2001), Dave and Janet essentially indicated that this was an important project to Enron, that we were entirely committed to seeing it through and that if it weren't for the damn CFE, we'd already be done, etc. etc.  I think if we stick to that line, we'll be fine.

There are several hurdles to overcome in structuring a deal to acquire 
Atlantic Copper and a long term copper concentrates supply from FM's 
Indonesian mine complex.   Current contract prices for copper smelting and 
refining capacity are low and they might be a bit unrealistic on price.    We 
suggested a conceptual structure that may work but is 
probably a long shot at this time.   They were interested and requested a 
more definitive proposal, which we will develop this week.

were looking over Connecticut's SIP rule because he noticed that 
1990 seemed too early.  Connecticut defines baseline EGUs as 
those that were operating prior to 1990 and those units are 
allocated from the main trading budget.  The change I would like to 
note is that the state also distinguishes between ""new units"" and 
""new EGUs.""  New EGUs are anything operating prior to the 2001 
season and they are allocated separately, but also from the main 
trading budget.  The point is that anything prior to 2001 will receive 
allowances from the main pool, they will just be allocated 
differently.  This won't affect our current tasks as Connecticut does 
not allocate until three months prior to the start of the season.  I 
am attaching a corrected table.

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

I wanted to let you know that, as of July 1, Jan Haizmann's responsibilities 
will expand to include competition issues in European energy markets.  As you 
know, in addition to his work for EBS in Europe, Jan has been spending 
considerable time directing EBS' government affairs work in Asia.   Due in 
large part to the progress he has made, we are now able to shift that effort 
to an individual in the region until a new hire is on board in Singapore.  

Jan will continue to spend approximately half of his time on EBS government 
affairs issues in Europe.  The remainder of his time, which previously was 
spent on Asia, now will be spent on European energy markets.  

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

We had 2 service outages today, the External Internet and Email both became unavailable at about 11:00 am today, service was restored in after about 15-20 minutes.  The fact that both services went down at the same time is only coincidence.

Below are the basic causes for the outages:

The Internet outage was caused by an error in one of our Network Routers.  The device was rebooted and service was restored.

The Email outage was caused by a bug in Exchange that is remedied by rebooting the server.

BRUSSELS, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Frantschach Pulp and Paper has ordered an automatic chip storage and reclaiming system for its two pulp lines at the Steti plant in the Czech Republic. The revamp will be implemented in two stages to avoid a shutdown. The first phase of the upgrade will be completed in February 2002 and the final work will be wrapped up in July 2002. 
 A spokesman said the Steti mill produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of bleached and unbleached kraft pulp. The new system will enhance safety and product quality. 
Steti's paper mill produces 200,000 tonnes/yr of sack paper, machine-glazed (MG) wrapping paper and linerboard. A revamp of the plant's PM is also planned for next year. The unit's 12,000 tonnes/yr capacity of MG paper is set to gradually rise to 31,000 tonnes/yr following the upgrade.","[{'word': 'July 18, 2001', 'tag': 'DATE'}, {'word': 'February 2002', 'tag': 'DATE'}, {'word': 'July 2002', 'tag': 'DATE'}, {'word': 'next year', 'tag': 'DATE'}, {'word': 'BRUSSELS', 'tag': 'LOCATION'}, {'word': 'Steti', 'tag': 'LOCATION'}, {'word': 'Czech Republic', 'tag': 'LOCATION'}, {'word': 'Frantschach Pulp and Paper', 'tag': 'ORG'}]","[('July 18, 2001', 'DATE'), ('February 2002', 'DATE'), ('July 2002', 'DATE'), ('next year', 'DATE'), ('BRUSSELS', 'LOCATION'), ('Steti', 'LOCATION'), ('Czech Republic', 'LOCATION'), ('Frantschach Pulp and Paper', 'ORG')]"

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

Attached are a clean copy of suggested modification of the body of this DASH as well as a copy of the original DASH.  This should give you some sense of the Arcos project's scale and risks.  John Sherriff and Michael Brown reportedly remain confident that this can be sold at a profit in the next three to nine months; however, if it is not, our economics on this project with a current termination cost of over $200 million is a negative NPV of approximately ($150 million).  The Enron board has not seen this, largely because the turbine cost is not specifically related to this project, but no other use of the turbines has been identified, so this project represents a huge potential loss if the sale is not successful.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.

This is the latest skew calculator file.  It has a sheet for the vol skew table, and it calculates the ENA pdf using a linear interpolation between points on the table, not a polynomial.  

The file shows yesterday's settle data for Jun, and ENA data matches very well.  (All the 2001 contracts agree closely with ENA data from yesterday, in fact.)  I've added a macro that fetches the underlying price, volatility, and interest rate from our in-house EGSPROD32 database.  Let me know if this doesn't work for you.

I had a chat with our people in Mexico and, as Mark Haedicke had warned me, 
they are very eager for me to go there.  They asked whether I could go there 
next week.  I think the purpose of the trip is to meet and for them to kind 
of let me know what they have.

I have no idea what if any, policy you have for travelling.  All things being 
equal, for me, the less travel the better but by the same token, I have 
absolutely no problem about going where I need to go.  I think these people 
in Mexico just need a little ""hand holding""  for a while. 

How do you want to deal with respect to my travelling?  Do you want to 
approve (or not) whenever I have to go or just want to know in advance?

nasty notes like 'try to get it right next time').   Luckily for both you and

-the cost will be 75-100bp's per amount of LC ie.  $1,000,000 =$7,500-$1,000
-the cost will be associated with the particular business group-most likely Enron Canada
-NGX will provide updates and so will Russel regarding the $30 MM credit
-We will have to be actively requesting our position
-Russel said he will be able to run real time data in a crunch situation but typically we can expect a one day lag

1. Gordon and Ryan advise that the swaps for assets in JEDI 1 and 2 will 
cover our proportionate economic interest in the asset within JEDI. Gordon

between Harrier and Talon and there will be no back-to-back swap with JEDI.

are hedged with Raptor and then sold to Condor,  there will be no reduction 
in the hedge or any back-to-back hedge when it moves into Condor. The swap

We talked about this point earlier (see an e-mail to you dated September 22, 
2000) and we agreed that the guarantees would not reference both Enron North 
America and Enron Canada Corp.  There were a number of reasons for this (ie. 
complexity regarding future amendments, the differences/peculiarities between 
Canadian and American law, possible ""permanent establishment"" issues we had 
discussed, etc.).  You may also want to look at the e-mail I sent to you on 
September 26, 2000 (re: the East desk deals with ENA).

Is this not the case anymore?  I think it is better to have separate 
guarantees for all of the reasons mentioned in the September 22, 2000 e-mail,

Thanks for the comments.  Here are my responses:

1.  Introductory Paragraph - Section (a) is unacceptable as this places an 
administrative burden on Enron that currently does not exist.  Section (b) is 
acceptable.

2.  Paragraph 3 - Changes are acceptable.

3.  Paragraph 4 -  Changes in this section are acceptable, however, it is 
Enron's strong preference that no indemnity language be included.

4.  Paragraph 5 - Deletion of this provision is unacceptable.

5.  Paragraph 6 - This deletion is fine.

You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book deal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no problem re the confidentiality agreement. 
 
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years and have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building experiences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minister / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.

We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  

AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

for construction.

Also, we will be asking FERC for clarification, or in the alternative for 
rehearing, that we will be allowed to construct water crossings after June 
1.  FERC misunderstood a request by FDEP that construction across water 
bodies be limited to the period between November 1 and June 1.  FDEP has 
issued our preliminary permits without this requirement, and has given us a 
letter confirming that we may construct after June 1.  We need to be able to

Sean sat down with Christian and I and explained his proposed product.  Theproduct works like this:  EPMI and a counterparty agree on a day-ahead basis to a quantity of power, a price for that power, a delivery point, and the hours at which the power will be scheduled.  The seller does not schedulethe power as a day-ahead schedule, however.  Instead, the supplier schedules the power on a real time basis on the day of delivery.  I made a small modification to Sean's proposed definition, which I think will clear up any ambiguity.

Thanks for the email.  I'm sure Paul has spoken to you by now.... but, Paul 
has sold 100% of this gas based on a Questar price for the entire month of 
November.  So, we [Entrada/Crescendo] will be receiving the IF Questar flat 
price no matter what pipe it flows on for November.  So, for November, it 
doesn't matter to me how you flow the gas, as long as it flows.  If moving

I went through the code and realized that the change to show months with 0 value is a little big change and cannot be done in hours. The problem I see is that when portcalc values a post id, it does not create any data in database for the months where you do not have positions. What it means it can be done but it will take minimum 3-4 days to make the changes, test it and give it to you. Also it will slow down option grid a little more as I need to build rows with 0 values which are not in database.

He will also definitely let you know if the surgery makes sense (for

I would like the following sentences added under the  I. Pilot Meter and
Meter Add-on Ownership Program.

""Customer ownership of meters and add-ons reduces the cost of new facilities
through the avoidance of the tax gross-up on contributions in aid of
construction.  This can be a significant dollar amount for large
interconnections which require special facilities which are paid by the
requesting customer.""

Please insert this between the 2nd and 3rd full sentences of the first
paragraph.  With this change, I do not think any additional testimony needs
to be filed on the meter issues.  This is the same approach in the PG&E
settlement and is not a Norm or Turn or Longbeach issue.  Any opposition can
be addressed in rebuttal.

I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not
realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and
run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results.
This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like
we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but 
does not solve the problem. 

In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is optimal.
I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C,
but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.

I am sending this document out to ensure that everyone knows what is required to process EPMI's Hanson Cement deal.  It is possible after reviewing all of the handoffs, that EPMI and EWS (Retail Generation) will wish to handle this deal in a different method.  

We need to come to some decisions very quickly.  There is a tremendous amount of coordination which needs to occur in order to service Hanson Cement.

I emailed my answers to 3 and 4 as soon as I got home last night - did
you get them and did they look OK for inclusion? I read over some of the
other members answers to the same questions and it looked like we
addressed slightly different areas on #3, so we should be able to merge
them together. On #4 I think I had a slightly different answer, I'm not
sure which is right.

We are going to do our best to pull materials together for Ken's briefing 
book by Friday cob so that Ken will have them to review and provide us 
feedback.  I'll keep you posted on how we're doing.  

Separately, Steve mentioned scheduling a pre-briefing before Ken leaves 
Houston.  This meeting would primarily include: Ken, Steve and Jeff 
Dasovich.  If you haven't already, will the two of you set some time aside 
for the guys to go over the briefing book and details of the schedule next

Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to
balance my commitments here.

Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members
while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition. We are
definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the
members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual
members could see way to convert to proprietary tools. The work that Shijie
Deng and Rajnish Kamat have been doing with me are good examples.

As to my trip, thanks for the invitation but I already committed myself to
get back Friday night so I will save my visit for another time.

Could you take a look at what I've put together? Conceivably, this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we (or I) could maintain, which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information.

I don't disagree with your comment however, my recollection is that one of the main reasons we made the decision we did was because the commercial folks didn't want to have to reopen the agreement with a rate amendment.  The concern I though was that such an overture would possibly send the wrong message to the customer or possibly create a perception that the customer had some leverage.  My question is, not that we need to amend the agreement for other reasons should we add the discounted rate... do it all at once?  Please provide your thoughts.  Thanks.

 1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as ""confirmed"" (this will allow us to sort for cut or ""confirmed"" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.

2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING.

Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's ""supplemental"" PHC statement reads:

""It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission.""

providing 867's.   If we can't get the 810s going then the information
provided in the attached spreadsheets needs to get to us in order to

I am going to be joining the Enron Associate Class of February 2002(from The
University of Chicago).

Sir, I have a question.  I was wondering what your thoughts might be regarding
the creation of an operation to trade interest rate products?  I am certain
that yield curve exposure is a significant source of risk that certain areas of
Enron must already be addressing.  However, to the best of my knowledge,  I
don't think Enron actually trades interest rate products?

If there is any interest in doing so, I would be very pleased to offer my time
to assist in researching the potential feasibility and profitability while
still a student, and before I report to Enron.

The master netting arrangements crossborder would need to be scrubbed for insolvency/preference/safe harbor etc. rules, as well as tax matters.  We were able to get comfortable to cross into Canada on the PGE transactions, but there were extra matters that had to be handled in respect of Canada/US tax issues.  I cannot offhand remember the resolution.  Suffice to say, if the credit benefit warrants an aggregation of contracts crossborder, then due diligence for legal and tax would need to be undertaken.  ISDA opinions may be helpful, or at least a place to begin.

Having discussed with Sharad, we think it would make sense for Sharad to go 
to Houston for a few weeks starting at the end of October.  This would 
overlap with Ben's visit in November and so some alternative arrangement 
would have to be made for accommodation.  If he goes after Ben then there 
will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until 
early next year.  Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so 
then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.

  I received a call today from Donna Lance, a trading lawyer at Koch.  She is 
trying to put together a corporate compliance policy for Koch and asked if we 
would be willing to share our work product in this area with her.  The 
specific areas she mentioned were insider trading and conflicts of interest

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility)

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

There will be a story in tomorrow's Financial Times about our trading position in Europe. Myself and John Sherriff spoke with London-based FT reporter Andy Taylor.

Andy is a long-standing contact and an Enron supporter. He spoke with various players in the European market and although they were supportive, they were also giving the impression that business with Enron had dropped 90%. 

This is not the case and it was therefore important to refute this. I'm comfortable with how the interview went. John made a point of saying how supportive counterparties had been and we did not discuss anything beyond our European trading position.

Will forward the coverage tomorrow.

I absolutely agree with you about the panels the last two years  they have been weak.  I think, though, that this should be looked at a little differently.  The purpose for this is to highlight the operations of our business and to showcase the next level of leadership.  I think rather than just focusing on one or two businesses, this format will allow us to hit each of them at a high level.  Mark will introduce each of you, talk a little about your backgrounds to help the VPs get familiar with our new leadership, and interject questions and generate discussion as appropriate.

Thank you very much for the great attendance and participation! Thanks, also, to all those who had to juggle this meeting with others.

Attached are the notes from the meeting for your review and comments. One of the recurring themes throughout the discussions seemed to be that we all need to do more upfront communication and work to make sure that scopes, estimates, and project intentions match. I think the meeting might have planted some seeds as to how we can work better and more efficiently together. All we need now is a little passion and comittment to help the seeds along.

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Robin

Here is your report for today. 

I also need to get your opinion on the following matter. 

We have been  working on a new look and feel for EnronOnline that includes expanded order functionality. This was expected to be released sometime in January. We think going ahead will act as an indicator that as far as our core businesses are concerned it is business as usual and we are contiuing to develop the platform.

Before proceeding however we would like to get your opinion on  whether this is something we should even be considering at this point . I also have some screen shots that I will bring by after trading for you to take a look at. I aprreciate your help.

The information that y'all had requested in the meeting does not contain any output or heat balancing information that you will need to assist in the sizing of the lateral.  Jennifer and I provided Fred Mitro information that contained capital cost, property taxes and some other modeling assumptions.  We did not give him any update or indication on where the output and heat rate numbers would be.

I have asked Jennifer to hold off sending you what was requested after today's meeting, because it is omitting the concrete information that you really need.

Just a couple of things regarding Delano for Sunday and Monday:

For Sunday, 8/5:
Delano is prescheduled at 30mw, so they have 15mw available to sell, HE1-24, SP15.  Please try to sell them for above their variable costs of $40.  It should be pretty warm on Sunday, so you should be able to sell them for most of the peak hours.

For Monday, 8/6:
Delano wants to implement the buy-back strategy once again.  So please try to buy-back 15mw, HE7-10, SP15, for below their variable costs of $40.  When you contact the control room, please only speak in ""hour ending.""  They said that would clear up some recent confusion on their part.

Have you or a member of your group had a chance to look over the forwarded e-mail yet?  We have a meeting on Thursday with another potential client who plans to use his own capital.  His capital budgeting issues are similar to those of the client who prompted my original e-mail.

The more DSM projects that we can help the client get approved, the more DSM savings we can share with the client.  These DSM projects can turn a retail commodity contract with low profitability into a substantially more profitable contract for us.

Would one of your GARCH analyses provide us with a quantitative solution?  One of your experts in differential equations might have devised something.We'd really like to have something quantitative if you think it's at all possible.

Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import (EPMICISOBLUE).  The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively.  A purchase from the imbalance has been made.  Also for HE 12,  we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule.  Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not.  We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them.  Therefore, the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation.  We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower. 

Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP.  We are flat in CAPS position manager.  And flat in Enpower.

rates in conformity with certain requirements set forth in that decision.
These standby rates are to viewed as interim, subject to change in
individual utility proceedings.

I have not reviewed the applications thoroughly.  Please let me know if you
would like me to do such or whether you wold like a copy of the applications

regarding simulating power prices in VAR we might discuss the following items
and show some results:
1. Clustering for power:
 - clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them;
 - geographical clustering;
 - flexibility in choosing ""core curves"" (based on position size);
2. Jump-diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month:
 - parameter estimation from historical data (do we want to use it?)
 - working out parameters (jumps frequency, jump size) as stress scenarios;
3. Correlations within a cluster and across clusters.
4. Changing correlations estimations (using fixed contact' time series).
5. Joint estimation of factors for selected regions.

Let me know what you think should be in the agenda for this meeting.

<33490757.1075853835834.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still 
billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 
3/31/2000.
  The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  

It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.

Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 
equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we 
should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal

Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.

Brazil: Elektro must revise balance sheets
Valor Economico, 12 Nov 2001, p. b-7:-
 The Brazilian electricity supply company Elektro must change and publish again its balance sheets of 2000 and of the first two quarters of 2001 according to a decision from the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM) and with the changes the losses registered by the company in those periods will increase.
CVM is against two procedures used by Elektro which were based on future profit expectations in a term between 10 and 20 years since it is too risky to make estimations for such a long term. The procedures are related to the accounting of social contributions and income tax credits.
Elektro is controlled by the US company Enron.","[{'word': '12 Nov 2001', 'tag': 'DATE'}, {'word': '2000', 'tag': 'DATE'}, {'word': 'the first two quarters of 2001', 'tag': 'DATE'}, {'word': 'Brazil', 'tag': 'LOCATION'}, {'word': 'Elektro', 'tag': 'ORG'}, {'word': 'Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM)', 'tag': 'ORG'}, {'word': 'Enron', 'tag': 'ORG'}]","[('12 Nov 2001', 'DATE'), ('2000', 'DATE'), ('the first two quarters of 2001', 'DATE'), ('Brazil', 'LOCATION'), ('Elektro', 'ORG'), ('Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM)', 'ORG'), ('Enron', 'ORG')]"

Williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group.  They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.  Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).  The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and 
just after you're born. 

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are 
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in 
fetuses and newborns. 

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic  or DHA  a fatty acid that helps 
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either 
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note 
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. 

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give 
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the 
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and 
mackerel.","[{'word': 'University of Connecticut', 'tag': 'LOCATION'}]","[('University of Connecticut', 'LOCATION')]"

Apparently, this may have started due to ""rumors"" that the London Receiver is allowing for such paymentsfor example, the pending Arcos turbine sale.  This is unsubstantiated, but may be worthy of inquiry.  Accordingly, in at least one domestic example, it is my understanding that the deal team was fairly unmotivated until they heard about the London ""arrangement"" and are now pursuing with great exuberance.

The RTO West Regional Representatives Group (RRG) meeting tentatively
scheduled for Friday, June 15, has been cancelled.  Good progress continues
to be made on congestion management, planning, pricing, liability, and
""seams"" issues.  Additional development of these issues by the work groups
is necessary before they will be ready for RRG consideration.  Thanks, too,
for the suggestions several of you have given us for potential consultants
for the cost-benefit analysis.

Assuming no major conflicts, we have tentatively scheduled Friday, June 29,
for the next RRG meeting.  We will confirm or re-schedule this June 29
meeting date as soon as we can.

Have a pleasant weekend.

As it turns out, in his review of the annual report of Welch he noted that it stated that Welch is a cooperative.  The original draft of the ISDA was not drafted with this knowledge as there was no indication from any source that Welch was a cooperative.  This fact needs to be confirmed, and if Welch is a cooperative, you will need to research the issue.  I attach for you a letter of issues  sent to outside counsel last year when we were investigating another proposed cooperative counterparty.  Hope this will help.

I have now gathered everyone's views and the consensus is that we should hire 
Sharad to work with me on front-office pricing and so we should proceed to 
the offer stage.  As you can see his salary is o43,500 currently and he 
appears to have a guaranteed bonus of o25,000 for next year.  He would join 
for o50,000 from my discussions with Alex Blair, the consultant.  He is very 
interested in Enron, but is also talking to Morgan Stanley.  I discussed with 
Vince, who recommended that Sharad should come in at the same level (rank) as

<23164995.1075849272581.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Agreed.  My initial thoughts 

1. More Government isn't the answer.  If this proves anything, it is that 
Government is the wrong party to manage consumer's energy price risk.  

2. This is a 10 year hangover.  The total bill $### billion.  

3. Direct Access is a better solution for California.  Let businesses manage 
their own needs, rather than a small public agency never designed to take on 
this task.

4. Too much, too late.  CDWR should have been buying to manage the cost for 
2001, not worrying about 2007.  Any contract that starts after Sept 2002 is 
simply not a part of any real solution.

By the way, I think that if pressed, Enron has to be very clear - we are not 
advocating abrogation of contracts.

draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the PD is 
misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state, and why our 
settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state.  
The letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement.  It needs 
to be released by the end of this week.  Absent this kind of action, 
nothing's going to turn this thing around.  Spending time and money writing 
""comments"" will be a waste of time and money.  We'll need to do a lot more,

2.4 Shaft energy interruptions.  Please review and call me with any

June 18, 1999.

Thanks for the quick response.  Yes, working in Europe has been a good
experience and certainly intellectually stimulating on many levels.
However, I'm probably not going to consult in 2002.  Not exactly my ""cup of
tea.""  It can be less than fulfilling coming in and out of projects and
never having the opportunity to actually start and finish an opportunity.
With that said, I am grateful for the experience and have definitely varied
my skill set as hopefully reflected in my resume.

I would imagine life at Enron has been challenging with the constant change
and bad press as of late.  I'm hopeful the worst is behind Enron and
smoother waters lie ahead.

right hands would be much appreciated.

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the ""NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS"" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as ""Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie"". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share
your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more of
a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of
Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble
deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and
settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative
processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of
working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available
opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity 
numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers 
from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the 
transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers 
much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly 
disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if 
you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy 
derivatives markets that would be helpful.

I don't know the answer to your 1st question since I don't recall ever
having to have insurance certificates on any of the other Facility

The Retention LC was faxed this am to Greg Lang and Isabell Parker.  Jaap's

Also, need to talk about Austin Tech reps being added to Facility Agreement

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.

Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that 
California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.  

Just wanted to pass along some info.  I'm sure you've seen Senator 
Feinstein's comments to FERC.  And I think you're aware that she held a 
meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on 
the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.  She stated 
at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to 
place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.  Economists in the room 
expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly 
focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.  Not sure where it

<7891791.1075840448711.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Gentlemen,

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of 
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having 
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence by 
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In 
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each 
turbine ID and status message.  

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status 
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be 
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in 
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

Comments?

When you have some time, can we get together on the circumstances under which 
we should charge a business unit for the addition of a new Product Type?

I'm thinking specifically of the units which do receive a cost allocation, 
but are adding products which in our opinion are of questionable economic 
benefit.

These could be charged in accordance with our current price schedule. i.e. 
new Product Types added to existing businesses could be charged the 
incremental setup fees.  New Businesses would be the 250K.

If the Product Type is of clear benefit (e.g. Options for US Gas and for the 
guys we are training this week), then the costs would be part of next year's 
allocation.

What do you think?

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

question as follows: Enron will continue to focus its attention on the

continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we 
believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a 
couple of years ago (for example, the  rising acceptance of online purchasing 
by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management 
possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential

In answer to your phone message I am sending you the following information.

There is one thing you probably need to be aware of.  On the Research
list, Elena Chilkina is shown as an Analyst P/T, however, in the records she
is shown as an ""Adm Coord"".  This was done so that she could be considered
non-exempt and receive overtime.  However, her actual job is an analyst.

Also, Roman Zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months
ago, but was never moved to the new group.  He is now up for rotation again
and Vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation.

If you have any questions, please call me.","[{'word': 'Elena Chilkina', 'tag': 'PERSON'}, {'word': 'Roman Zadarozhny', 'tag': 'PERSON'}, {'word': 'Vince', 'tag': 'PERSON'}]","[('Elena Chilkina', 'PERSON'), ('Roman Zadarozhny', 'PERSON'), ('Vince', 'PERSON')]"

Do you have a deal diagram?  Is there a commodity swap between ENA and

The TD/ENA commodity swap has language regarding ""loan repayment"" and the 
""fee"".  Has Matt seen this?  Shouldn't this be in a separate document?  Also, 
I'm not sure what TD is tyring to net (quarterly payments under the swap with

I refer to the List of Samples I crculated by fax yesterday (copy attached 
for your easy reference).

The Batangas samples referred to in Ref. Page 3 have arrived at SGS 
Singapore. SGS Philippines has explained to Eric why some containers are not 
full :-

The individual tank samples were drawn ex Pacific Virgo and put into 
containers but were not sealed. They were transported to the Subic Bay lab 
where ship's composite samples were made for testing by mixing the samples. 
The remainder was put into containers and sealed. One ship's composite sample 
was tested. Parts of some other sealed samples were used (ie. seals broken) 
for verification tests. The remainder were re-sealed, hence some containers 
are not full.

Please advise whether you wish for us at this juncture to enquire with SGS

at $108 until April  30, 2002, and decoupling the cap from California's
reserve deficiency, and instead tying the cap to the price of natural
gas (upwards, only).

2. Denial of Requests for Rehearing (in great part) on all California
Orders since last December 15 (2000), and ordering the California ISO to
submit a revised congestion management plan, and a plan for establishing

price caps scaring away investment.  Would Southern and Reliant fit this bill?

Is that our policy or are these issues being addressed on a case by case basis?

While Enron's management teams are reviewing actions plans for the upcoming six to nine months, I understand that functional transition teams will be assembled to address the planned merger.  I would like to register my strong interest in assisting any transition team where my skills could add value. Prior to developing and supporting corporate as well as enterprise systems at Enron my career has spanned across General Electric Capital Services and ABB on a global basis. Much of this experience has included system integration and change management.  

Let me know if you have any questions to the above.  Otherwise, I wanted to let you know of my interest and desire in working towards a successful transition for Enron.

If we delay, they may revert in Nov to operating and scheduling volumes according to the existing agreement and not the settlement agreement, which is bad for ENA.  A bit of a balancing act but I think that I have it under control.  My question is this.  Can I move forward with the execution of the Settlement IF the payment is not required until Nov 30 ?  I am sorry and I may be splitting hairs, but don't want this to slip away.  If I need to hold off on everything I will do what is needed.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.

letter drafted by Jacqueline Hamilton (which John will convey to you directly
internally, per Mark Freeman's representation to me), where he will be a

employee of the U.S. entity which is already a client of Instinet in the U.S.

2) Once Enron decides on the longer-term corporate structure which they wish 
to
use in the future, subject to our concurrence, we will 'transition' from the
state originally desired by John Greene.

I definitely agree with your assessment.  We have a few other fish to chaseright now before we give up the boat.

A few thoughts:  TIBCO is proposing a sales channel arrangement that essentially keeps Enron very much in the software business.  If we decide that weare comfortable having a foot in the software business for a period of time, we can always sign up sales channels, including TIBCO, whenever we are ready to do so.  Collaborating with a channel partner is a lot of work; in fact, initially it is actually more difficult than doing everything yourself.  So before we jump into the channels world, we would need to decide that we are ready to put the resources to the effort.  Regards.

Great job at actually getting something (almost) in writing from HL&P!

The big poles are just not suitable for neighborhood use, simply too big.  I
am, therefore, selfishly relieved that they are not continuing along my
street.  With all the townhome development, plus these mega-poles, what else
can be done to destroy the traditional appearance of our area?  Maybe
they'll put an environmentally sensitive second deck 20' above Montrose to
bypass the ailing downtown highways?

The attached explanation does however beg the question why there's one of
the new pole holes been dug on the NE corner of Peden and Montrose, when the

<24261174.1075852149221.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Good Morning,

Last Tuesday I attended the OATI training on E-Tag 1.7 in Houston.  Although this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to the Test site sometime in November or December.

This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice.  Also, because the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not work.  New templates will need to be created.

Please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and I will work up a series of them for January and February.


Thanks,

FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to 
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to 
do as much as I could before I left.

Just thought I'd send you an email to give you the details we discussed today.  We bought 51,042 mmbtu from Puget Sound in May 2001 at Kingsgate.

mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms

eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their 
agreement.  

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms 
for GTC-governed  transactions without asking the customer first.  Whether or 
not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will 
leave to others.  Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you

<20116146.1075840579315.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"John,

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar Days ( Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Let me know if this helps.

<17295259.1075842773607.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"John,  Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions.  The 
following items of note were revised.

1.  Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty.  
Enron will only provide a payment guaranty.  Enron does not have the means to 
ensure performance by the LLC.  Thus the language needs to clearly identify 
that this is a payment guaranty.  As long as Transco gets paid for the 
transport, I am not sure why this matters.

2.  Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their 
tariff.  Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the 
ability to recover double interest on late payments.  Thus, the interest 
language in the guaranty was removed.  

Please review the revised guaranty.  I would be happy to discuss these issues 
with Transco's attorney's at their convenience.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.","[{'word': 'John', 'tag': 'PERSON'}, {'word': 'Transco', 'tag': 'ORG'}, {'word': 'Enron', 'tag': 'ORG'}, {'word': 'LLC', 'tag': 'ORG'}]","[('John', 'PERSON'), ('Transco', 'ORG'), ('Enron', 'ORG'), ('LLC', 'ORG')]"

penalize customers for failing to curtail during Stage 3 conditions.  This 
may be detrimental to EESI to the extent the customer does not curtail and 
EESI is expected to cover the cost of the penalties per our contract with the 
customer.  This penalty is unacceptable if we are expected by the customer to 
pay the penalties.  The plan does provide for putting the customer in a 
Rotating Outage queue
if the customers fails to curtail on two occassions.  In my opinion, there 
should not be any financial penalties and instead the customer is switched 
immediately to a Rotating Outage queue if the customer fails to curtail.  The 
customer option to ""buy through"" may financially harm us.  Dennis, any

there was an assignment from Valero Gas Marketing L.P. to Valero Marketing &

John Ayres and I met today.  He wishes to add the interconnect piping
between the chiller and cooling tower options in Exhibit N-2 for the ESA
Electrobolt Project.  This adds a total of $ 266,400 to the Jan 15, 2001
payment (equal to $ 33,280 per unit).  There will be no effect on the
12/27/00 payment amount.  I've edited your spread sheet to show this.

John Ayres asked if he could have a stripped down version of the Spread
sheet showing only the ESA amounts.

Kay, You'll notice that the Cooling Tower Option is Exhibit N-2 was changed
to add this interconnect piping to the scope.

I hope this helps.

I'm pretty sure that the commissions are included on statements and charge to us daily.  Therefore, the numbers that we are confirming as either excess or margin call, is inclusive of the fees.  I believe Jason Fisher would have the exact amount of the fees.  I know this question has been proposed several times and I've always refered them directly to Jason, and I'm assuming that he was able to help as I never heard back from anyone.

Agreement between Enron North America Corp. (""Enron"") and Morgan Stanley

Dear Susan:

Pursuant to the discussions between Anthony Lupiano of our Credit
Department and Bill Bradford of your Credit Department yesterday,
attached you will find a proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy
Price Swap Agreement.  The purpose of this Fourth Amendment is to amend
the Exposure Threshold definition.    It is my understanding that Mr.

Just a heads up to let you know that there is a new product type awaiting 
your approval (currently ""Partially Approved"") in EnronOnline Datamanager. It 
is an Australian power financial spread product (#2001) and will be an 
inter-regional spread using the existing financial power swap products i.e. 
VIC, SA, NSW & QLD peak & flat products as the underlying contracts.

Our senior legal counsel in the Sydney office, David Minns, has indicated 
that the existing GTC for Australian power products (see attached) can also 
be used for this new product type.

I would appreciate it if you could review this as soon as possible. Please 
let me know if you require anything further.

Note, a sigma factor (4.07) has been assigned by RAC which will be amended 
after the product type has been approved.

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

big position for November so we need to get this pushed off until December or

provide this to your counsel as a basis for the questionnaire regarding the

issues may be the location of the respective geographical points for each

their jurisdiction. (ie. A German counterparty trading Bandwidth from

<685271.1075852754266.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"We intend to start officializing a gas book for our Enron Direct business starting July 3rd.  From this officialized book credit, VAR, cashflows and positions can be pulled.  It will be a relatively flat book because every deal with a 3rd party has been backed with our trading desk.  The name of the book in FT-CAND-DIRECT.  There will be a consolidated price and basis book and an index book.  The portfolio code is 6*.  The currrent MTM of the portfolio is approx $1M USD and is comprised of about 10 different counterparties.  The positions and VAR should be reported under McKay.

<2826937.1075862373832.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"The attached press release is the latest draft, which has been approved by Enron and one part of Citigroup.  JPMorgan is still reviewing, as is another part of Citigroup.  The release includes several bracketed phrases and sentences that are still being discussed. 

In the first paragraph, Citigroup wants to use ""including due diligence"" and delete ""final.""

In the fifth paragraph, Citigroup wants to use the phrase ""in a few days"" rather than ""shortly.""

The quote from JPMorgan may or may not be in the final release.

Once the terms of the agreement are finalized, we plan to issue this release before the opening of the market Thursday (6 a.m.).  If you have any comments or changes, please let me and Steve Kean know by email or voicemail.

Thank you.
