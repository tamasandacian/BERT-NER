<17217905.1075853978006.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Tina,
Koch never returned my calls. Based on the contractual information, we may be 
putting ourselves in a risk area by 'assigning' the deals without proper 
documentation. The documentation that was supplied did not refence any ENA 
agreements, nor any specific meter numbers. If the purchase was indeed a 
meter/well sale; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired 
and the effective date. Since we are apparently the supplier, the risk is not 
as substaintial as if we were the purchaser. However, without documentation 
we are basically relying on the relationship btw Koch & Duke.

<28372483.1075843343800.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I wanted to follow-up with everyone following yesterday's meeting. 

It appears to me that we need to develop (1) a better analysis of the four 
market models - AGL (Steve M), Columbia of Ohio (Janine), Socal Gas (Jeff), 
NICOR (Roy) - based on some key elements and (2) the key Influence parties in 
Illinois with 5 layer Influence Circles that we need to be thinking about in 
this discussion.

It would be great if we could get this to Laura for distribution by end of 
day Friday (realize it's tight).

Key elements for Market Models 

1. Direct Access Allowed?  For What customers?  What timeline?
2. Upstream Capacity resolution - assignment or otherwise?  Are there assets 
left to optimize
3. Retail pricing - Fixed price vs. PBR (how?) vs. something else?
4. Role of Wholesale Outsourcing Agent (would ENA sell to marketers or 
utilities or both?)
5. Other Issues

  I agree with you that it's a lesson people need to learn
over and over again.  I can't tell you how many politicians
I met over the past year who really don't like markets and
certainly don't understand how or why they work.  These
aren't just the minor leaguers in Sacramento, but the big
league players in Washington.

  I also agree that the academic community can play ""an important
role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of
deregulation process.""  I'd like to think that is in large

<2233799.1075843999023.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Steve,

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to 
determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from 
Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily, 
Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily 
decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the 
curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.

Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run 
will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to 
move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect 
their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing 
sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily 
be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will 
realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.

bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.  We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.  If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in.  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.  Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?

Some options:

1.   Capitalize as software development cost and amortize at FERC approved rate of 4.4% to DD&A. (The implied amortization period is substantially longer than the expected useful life of the software).

2.  Capitalize as software development cost and amortize using Corporate Standard rate of 20% to DD&A.  (Would not want to have this rate applied to all of our other unamortized software development costs).

3.  Hold balance in deferred debits (as deferred O&M) and amortize to Marketing O&M expense over the 5 year useful life of the project (per project economics).

example, we'd post  a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01March 02 Permian

post a method saying the winner is the one who pays the highest option fee so

I have no way of being able to discuss cost implications of changing the
post card language, since I do not know the current costs and have not
reviewed the ERCOT contract for the customer care center.  Prior to the
meeting, could someone at ERCOT forward that information including a break
out for the mailing cost and also invite a person from the subcontractor to
prepare estimates on the costs associated with the changes (such as going to
a larger card or envelope to assure that customers get all the necessary
information to make an informed decision)?

Also, could we begin at 2 instead of 1?   Three hours should be more than
adequate and the time conflicts with another PUC/Gov. office function.
