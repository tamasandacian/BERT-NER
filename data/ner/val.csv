""Please be advised that effective July 17, 2000, MGplc was aquired by the 
Enron group. MG London Inc was part of the MGplc group.

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport:	transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward
MGAF transport:		write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:		Kam to review and explain
Annuity:				Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above

I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of 
Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14"" monitors 
per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.  Will 
try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, 
attractive look.    

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve 
Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs 
are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, 
non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have 
a 3 month implementation schedule.

Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) 
or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc.

I believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit 
issue.  However, it may
make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed 
in the future. 

I am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit, which is built into 
the strike price for the
digital option. With the tax credit,  it is most likely the option will be 
exercised.

As per our conversation yesterday, I suggest that we put the two trades that you closed with us in January (25 MW baseload swap, 1 year, Feb. 01 to Jan 02) back on the MTM books and give you simultaneously the opportunity to close these positions.  Our prices for  June 01 - Jan 02 swap rates are as follows:

Argentina power $18.50 - $20.40 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in US dollars; you are currently long)
Brazil power R$425 - R$475 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in reais; you are currently short);

We are also making sure that there will be no adverse tax impact for Enron.

Please let me know if you agree to close these positions.

Just as a final cross-check to make sure we are all operating under the same understanding for Willamette, they have been paid the full amount plus an overage of $25.  They will not be receiving any additional funds on 5/31, nor will they be charged for the overage.  The amount overpaid to them will be included  in the entry for ECTstCA.

the customer had not signed an ISDA Master Agreement.  The index language can 
be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of

I am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of Pluto/MEGS to Duke Energy Field Services as well as the sale of the Napoleonville Land to Texas Brine.  In addition, I am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in Dow Wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from Dow.

Are there any types of transactions that would be ""inappropriate"" to close?  For example, if we do an outsourcing deal for three years, how do we know that Dynegy will honor the contract?

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu and

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the

<23063110.1075856309795.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of 
credit support for MG and PaperCo.

My approach is as follows:

1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.
2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.
3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the 
default option)  using Black's formula.
4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is 
treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back 
this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced 
rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two 
NPV's.

I did not receive the job announcement we spoke about.  I thought maybe the e-mail address I gave you did not get relayed accurately, so I thought I would send you a note.  Maybe you could attach the announcement to this and respond.

You were so very right in what you said the other night.  There definitely is a new day each day with the Enrongate.  Hang in there.  The callous few will not ruin everything for everyone else.  It seems bad now, but I have faith that something good will come from all of this.

You may wish to specify throughout that all time references are to ""GMT""
The examples given for the offline nominations procedures imply that 
nominations/re-nominations made by the customer are NOT effective until Enron 
has  responded affirmatively - this is not how the underlying GTC reads 
(under which such customer nominations/re-nominations become effective 
without subsequent Enron's ""confirmation"")
On the last page , I would remove the reference to a Master, since this does 
not currently apply to EnBank trades
Presumably , you are not now proceeding on the basis of a separate ATA (i.e.

Thanks very much for taking the time to talk with me about my
electricity model when you visited Carnegie Mellon. (I was the PhD

you mentioned the possibility of further developing my model at Enron.

I spoke with Robin, and from what we know Canada officializes one calc that 
includes both their price and basis positions.  (Calc is represented by the 
orange)    However, Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns 
the post id. (It appears that it is only the PRC book that comes through, the 
BAS book is represented by the red ""x"", however it is in the same calc.).  
Since the Canadian post id only includes two books ids,  the Benchmark group 
manually assign the same post id to the basis book, that way both books get 
picked up.

balance sheet.  If you have some time can we speak about various aspects of
the business?  I know you are busy, and not necessarily as familiar with the
off balances sheet structures, but perhaps you could be of some assistance.
I think your the smartest guy I know that still works there.  Maybe its your
Penn roots.

I am in Houston over Thanksgiving.  Perhaps we can finally get that long
awaited drink you owe me!  If in London please give me a call.  I have a
great place here you are welcome to crash at.

1.  Continued to see increased volumes and transactions on desk.  As of 
November, we have increased volumes to over 5 Bcf/day, up from about 2 
Bcf/day last six month period.  We are continuing to handle month end close, 
and get all volumes scheduled daily.

2.  Continued to give support to the contract exchange project.  We have 
given my time and the resources from the group.

3.  Re-staffed the group after we lost some key, experienced personnel.  We 
have the new guys up and running and hope to really make some things happen 
from here on out.

the so-called acceleration directives being considered in Stockholm this 
week.  I suggested using Ken/Jeff/john Sherriff as the quoted, laudatory 
official in the company, but the view seems to be that if we quote them, they 
have to be up to speed to respond to other press inquiries, i.e., subsequent 
inquiries cannot be deflected to more junior people like Peter or me.  Any 
way, both an explanation of why we did not use Ken or Jeff, and fyi, what we

however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohane

Commercial and legal resources from Houston will manage this issue on a go 
forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time. 
You have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts 
on that front are much appreciated.  Our focus should return to growing the 
business and meeting our financial targets.

Peter, I believe that Mark H. would like you to stay involved through the

I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the only 
open points relate to :

1. the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think 
about what I e-mailed to you?

2. DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the ""materially 
weaker"" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.

3. Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation 
procedures.

4. DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I guess 
we still need to discuss the :defenses"" language because as I indicated to 
you, I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.

I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.

I spoke to the postmaster and she stated that the
mailbox needs to be placed either to the side of the
gate or outside of the gate.  She said that the main
office does not like the fact that the postmasters
have a key to a residence.  I don't know whether you
have had the opportunity to speak with them yet.  If
so, please disregard.

Secondly, were you planning on having an electrician
come do any work on your house?  If so, I would like
to see if he/she can put a light in the bathroom as
well as electrical outlets.

I'll be awaiting your response.  Thanks!
