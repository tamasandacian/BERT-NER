Summary:
Currently, in California,  area codes cannot be approved based on specific

This bill would require the Public Utilities Commission to request authority 
from the Federal Communications Commission to require telephone corporations 
to establish technology specific area codes based on wireless and data 
communications.  This bill would also prohibit the Public Utilities 
Commission from approving new area code splits or overlays unless a 
technology specific area code had been established in the affected area and

Based on the input I have received from TW thus far, Indicated Shippers demands may make a settlement impossible.

Tuesdays only while you are going to rodeo meetings?  I know in her email she 
had a preference for not doing the Sharon thing, and I do think we lost 
something when we (well, you) weren't communicating with Sharon or Amy in a 
regular basis.  I know it is easy for me to say since it is an inconvenience

<2233799.1075843999023.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Steve,

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to 
determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from 
Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily, 
Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily 
decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the 
curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.

You had suggested some ""wholesalers"" and utilities the conference and I don't
know which if any are pure generating companies.  Would you say that SCE and
PG&E suffer from high prices and therefore support price caps?  We're thinking
of Bryson and Glynn and I want to make sure someone can speak to the issue of
price caps scaring away investment.  Would Southern and Reliant fit this bill?

Thanks a ton.  Sorry that the school's fundraiser called, I hope that didn't
bother you.

Here are your wholesalers and utilities:

 * Dynegy
 * Enron

As for Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.

It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it 
was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but 
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a 
result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in 
the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to 
draft a rewrite of these areas.  

Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before 
we share the information with Portland.

1990 seemed too early.  Connecticut defines baseline EGUs as 
those that were operating prior to 1990 and those units are 
allocated from the main trading budget.  The change I would like to 
note is that the state also distinguishes between ""new units"" and 
""new EGUs.""  New EGUs are anything operating prior to the 2001 
season and they are allocated separately, but also from the main 
trading budget.  The point is that anything prior to 2001 will receive 
allowances from the main pool, they will just be allocated

not allocate until three months prior to the start of the season.  I

calendars for some upcoming events.  Madeline's
baptism is going to be Saturday, April 6th during the
5:30pm mass.  We plan on having a little celebration
at our house afterwards.  If you can't make it, we
understand, but we'd love to have you come.

We talked about doing Stacey's baby shower the next
weekend, April 13 at Kathy's house.  Does that date
still work for everyone?  Let us know soon so we can
start making plans.

Talk to you soon.
Angela

P.S. for Chris - If you think you can come for one of
the weekends, you should choose Stacey's shower - it
won't hurt my feelings!  :)

I know that we cannot move all the Service Groups, but you had agreed that we could move all the E&C Employees in Jerry Martin's organization to 1202 and a number of the Ops. Support Services Employees (in Morris's organization) that support all of the pipelines and are NOT mostly dedicated to just one company.

Please confirm so we can work with HR to have these employees moved at year end.

Also, have there been any further updates from regulatory regarding a more encompassing move of employees to one service company?

Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK under the
circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm transitioning to an
advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational mode, rather
than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the Palo Alto

All Bearings (#1,#2,#3)
All seals #1 brg, IGV & variable stators, #2 brg, #3 brg, #1

All hardware (nuts, bolts, washers for cases, housings etc.)
All gaskets and packings (air/oil tube, oil drain tubes etc)
All o-rings (oil inlet tubes, etc)

You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying, 
high-rolling

someone else to 
do it for you. This union requires periodic reality checks. You share each 
others ideals, interests

When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but 
never boring.

disruptions
defeat me I have two brief initial comments (beyond commending all involved 
for
making this significant effort):

1. To avoid alienating readers unnecessarily, I would suggest using a
subjunctive tense throughout, as in ""would"", rather than the rhetoric of
""shall.""  E.g., ""a forward contract would be deemed reasonable,"" as opposed to
""shall be deemed reasonable.""

2. On the rate stabilization plan, please avoid proposals that involve 
freezing
the entire bundled electricity charge, as opposed to the generation commodity
charge.  Several stakeholders, including but not limited to NRDC, UCAN and 
PG&E,
support distribution pricing systems that involve regular small true-ups of 
the
rates that recover distribution revenues; frozen distribution charges are
incompatible with such systems.  I hope all involved will agree not to 
prejudge
this important issue in the rate stabilization proposal.",neutral

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility)
Date
Path
Cuts

Is the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?

It appears to me that we need to develop (1) a better analysis of the four 
market models - AGL (Steve M), Columbia of Ohio (Janine), Socal Gas (Jeff), 
NICOR (Roy) - based on some key elements and (2) the key Influence parties in 
Illinois with 5 layer Influence Circles that we need to be thinking about in 
this discussion.

It would be great if we could get this to Laura for distribution by end of 
day Friday (realize it's tight).

Key elements for Market Models 

1. Direct Access Allowed?  For What customers?  What timeline?
2. Upstream Capacity resolution - assignment or otherwise?  Are there assets 
left to optimize
3. Retail pricing - Fixed price vs. PBR (how?) vs. something else?
4. Role of Wholesale Outsourcing Agent (would ENA sell to marketers or 
utilities or both?)
5. Other Issues

I think the following is appropriate and I can get done:

Equity - $150

Mcdonald:
Base - Same
Cash - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet:
Base - Same
Cash - $100

I know these are at the top end.  For what it is worth, the other guys I got done this year were not at the top end because I did not believe it was necessary (Gilbert, Page, Etringer, Thome, Wehn).

If we can say done, the actual contract process can be slowed so that the equity is not set till the November meeting.  Also, if we get done, I wont bug you anymore!

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and 
just after you're born. 

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are 
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in 
fetuses and newborns. 

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic  or DHA  a fatty acid that helps 
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either 
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note 
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. 

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give 
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the 
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and

You requested that I give you a list of things to avoid discussion with ABB.  We've maintained a reasonably open relationship with ABB up to this point, but here are some (fairly obvious) things that we should probably steer clear of:

1.  No discussion about Fronterra;
2.  No specifics about the DeAcero contract, e.g. extension date, CP's, etc; and
3.  No discussion about project credit issues or financing alternatives for the project.

When this ABB contingent was here last (Feb 2001), Dave and Janet essentially indicated that this was an important project to Enron, that we were entirely committed to seeing it through and that if it weren't for the damn CFE, we'd already be done, etc. etc.  I think if we stick to that line, we'll be fine.

Koch never returned my calls. Based on the contractual information, we may be 
putting ourselves in a risk area by 'assigning' the deals without proper 
documentation. The documentation that was supplied did not refence any ENA 
agreements, nor any specific meter numbers. If the purchase was indeed a 
meter/well sale; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired 
and the effective date. Since we are apparently the supplier, the risk is not

I absolutely agree with you about the panels the last two years  they have been weak.  I think, though, that this should be looked at a little differently.  The purpose for this is to highlight the operations of our business and to showcase the next level of leadership.  I think rather than just focusing on one or two businesses, this format will allow us to hit each of them at a high level.  Mark will introduce each of you, talk a little about your backgrounds to help the VPs get familiar with our new leadership, and interject questions and generate discussion as appropriate.  To be honest, I see it as ""rapid fire business unit presentations"" as opposed to the typical panel.  

Let me know if you get a different sense from Mark.

For 8/1/00, allocate the receipt of gas a Cotton Valley to the exchange 
deal.  Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement

We talked about this point earlier (see an e-mail to you dated September 22,

America and Enron Canada Corp.  There were a number of reasons for this (ie. 
complexity regarding future amendments, the differences/peculiarities between 
Canadian and American law, possible ""permanent establishment"" issues we had 
discussed, etc.).  You may also want to look at the e-mail I sent to you on 
September 26, 2000 (re: the East desk deals with ENA).

Jennifer and I provided Fred Mitro information that contained capital cost, property taxes and some other modeling assumptions.  We did not give him any update or indication on where the output and heat rate numbers would be.

I have asked Jennifer to hold off sending you what was requested after today's meeting, because it is omitting the concrete information that you really need.  As soon as we receive new output and heat rate information, I will forward it directly.  If, for some reason, you need capital costs and property tax information, let me know.

Thanks,
Mathew",neutral

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

I would be happy to sit down and discuss any plans you may (or may not have) for me. I'm a big boy - and I realise how serious this situation is.

trying to put together a corporate compliance policy for Koch and asked if we 
would be willing to share our work product in this area with her.  The 
specific areas she mentioned were insider trading and conflicts of interest

I definitely agree with your assessment.  We have a few other fish to chaseright now before we give up the boat.

A few thoughts:  TIBCO is proposing a sales channel arrangement that essentially keeps Enron very much in the software business.  If we decide that weare comfortable having a foot in the software business for a period of time, we can always sign up sales channels, including TIBCO, whenever we are ready to do so.  Collaborating with a channel partner is a lot of work; in fact, initially it is actually more difficult than doing everything yourself.  So before we jump into the channels world, we would need to decide that we are ready to put the resources to the effort.  Regards.

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

public information available then.  In the meantime, I would answer the 
question as follows: Enron will continue to focus its attention on the 
commercial, light manufacturing and industrial end user markets. Enron 
continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we 
believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a 
couple of years ago (for example, the  rising acceptance of online purchasing 
by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management 
possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential 
markets). We believe, however, that the residential market opportunity is 
best pursued through a separate entity outside of Enron

The RTO West Regional Representatives Group (RRG) meeting tentatively
scheduled for Friday, June 15, has been cancelled.  Good progress continues
to be made on congestion management, planning, pricing, liability, and
""seams"" issues.  Additional development of these issues by the work groups
is necessary before they will be ready for RRG consideration.  Thanks, too,
for the suggestions several of you have given us for potential consultants
for the cost-benefit analysis.

Assuming no major conflicts, we have tentatively scheduled Friday, June 29,
for the next RRG meeting.  We will confirm or re-schedule this June 29

On  Friday, Socalgas?filed a protest to the emergency application we filed 
on  Thursday which asked the CPUC to exercise its authority under Public 
Utility  Code section 2774 and order Socalgas to provide use with emergency 
assistance to  avert core gas supply shortages.? Socalgas asserts (1) section 
2774 does  not apply to gas shortages arising from financial difficulties; 
(2) the  emergency assistance we requested would jeopardize its financial 
viability and  ability to provide gas service to its own core customers; (3) 
the requested  relief would be an unconstitutional taking of its property; 
and (4) PG&E has  not exhausted its own remedies  in particular, the

Great job at actually getting something (almost) in writing from HL&P!

The big poles are just not suitable for neighborhood use, simply too big.  I
am, therefore, selfishly relieved that they are not continuing along my
street.  With all the townhome development, plus these mega-poles, what else
can be done to destroy the traditional appearance of our area?  Maybe
they'll put an environmentally sensitive second deck 20' above Montrose to
bypass the ailing downtown highways?

The attached explanation does however beg the question why there's one of
the new pole holes been dug on the NE corner of Peden and Montrose, when the
line runs down the west side of Montrose Blvd. and then west on Peden.

I refer to the List of Samples I crculated by fax yesterday (copy attached 
for your easy reference).

The Batangas samples referred to in Ref. Page 3 have arrived at SGS 
Singapore. SGS Philippines has explained to Eric why some containers are not 
full :-

The individual tank samples were drawn ex Pacific Virgo and put into 
containers but were not sealed. They were transported to the Subic Bay lab 
where ship's composite samples were made for testing by mixing the samples. 
The remainder was put into containers and sealed. One ship's composite sample 
was tested. Parts of some other sealed samples were used (ie. seals broken) 
for verification tests. The remainder were re-sealed, hence some containers 
are not full.

Please advise whether you wish for us at this juncture to enquire with SGS 
Philippines about the results/raw data of the verification tests.

I don't disagree with your comment however, my recollection is that one of the main reasons we made the decision we did was because the commercial folks didn't want to have to reopen the agreement with a rate amendment.  The concern I though was that such an overture would possibly send the wrong message to the customer or possibly create a perception that the customer had some leverage.  My question is, not that we need to amend the agreement for other reasons should we add the discounted rate... do it all at once?  Please provide your thoughts.  Thanks.  Greg",neutral

BRUSSELS, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Frantschach Pulp and Paper has ordered an automatic chip storage and reclaiming system for its two pulp lines at the Steti plant in the Czech Republic. The revamp will be implemented in two stages to avoid a shutdown. The first phase of the upgrade will be completed in February 2002 and the final work will be wrapped up in July 2002. 
 A spokesman said the Steti mill produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of bleached and unbleached kraft pulp. The new system will enhance safety and product quality. 
Steti's paper mill produces 200,000 tonnes/yr of sack paper, machine-glazed (MG) wrapping paper and linerboard. A revamp of the plant's PM is also planned for next year. The unit's 12,000 tonnes/yr capacity of MG paper is set to gradually rise to 31,000 tonnes/yr following the upgrade.",neutral

I was thinking that it might be helpful for us to take Series 7 exam here in

research and found that our ""compliance"" group has to open an account with

I believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit 
issue.  However, it may
make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed 
in the future. 

I am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit, which is built into 
the strike price for the
digital option. With the tax credit,  it is most likely the option will be 
exercised.

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not
realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and
run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results.
This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like
we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but 
does not solve the problem. 

In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is optimal.
I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C,
but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Just a heads up to let you know that there is a new product type awaiting 
your approval (currently ""Partially Approved"") in EnronOnline Datamanager. It 
is an Australian power financial spread product (#2001) and will be an 
inter-regional spread using the existing financial power swap products i.e. 
VIC, SA, NSW & QLD peak & flat products as the underlying contracts.

Our senior legal counsel in the Sydney office, David Minns, has indicated 
that the existing GTC for Australian power products (see attached) can also 
be used for this new product type.

I would appreciate it if you could review this as soon as possible. Please 
let me know if you require anything further.

Note, a sigma factor (4.07) has been assigned by RAC which will be amended 
after the product type has been approved.

  Do you know :
  If there are 3 strips in a deal that cover different time periods, say April 1 for a strip, April 2 for another strip, and April 3 - 31 for a third strip....if we plug in a price on only one of the strips, are the days from the other strips going to get valued properly?  

 In the instances that we have had, all three strips were filled in and Risk valued the deal properly; it was just CARP and UNIFY that were reading three times the MW Month amount, which I guess in the end is a simple problem.

Last Tuesday I attended the OATI training on E-Tag 1.7 in Houston.  Although this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to the Test site sometime in November or December.

This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice.  Also, because the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not work.  New templates will need to be created.

Please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and I will work up a series of them for January and February.

Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import (EPMICISOBLUE).  The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively.  A purchase from the imbalance has been made.  Also for HE 12,  we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule.  Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not.  We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them.  Therefore, the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation.  We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower. 

Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP.  We are flat in CAPS position manager.  And flat in Enpower.

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    

Thanks

I am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of Pluto/MEGS to Duke Energy Field Services as well as the sale of the Napoleonville Land to Texas Brine.  In addition, I am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in Dow Wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from Dow.

Are there any types of transactions that would be ""inappropriate"" to close?  For example, if we do an outsourcing deal for three years, how do we know that Dynegy will honor the contract?

1.	Great job.
2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time  The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  
3.	Thanks for getting in ""Network Plus"" - it's the little things that matter.
4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.

I went through the code and realized that the change to show months with 0 value is a little big change and cannot be done in hours. The problem I see is that when portcalc values a post id, it does not create any data in database for the months where you do not have positions. What it means it can be done but it will take minimum 3-4 days to make the changes, test it and give it to you. Also it will slow down option grid a little more as I need to build rows with 0 values which are not in database. I just wanted to give you an update and I will talk to Karima & Francis to let them know how we are going to handle it.

<4280411.1075854488030.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE 
and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by 
Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run 
will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to 
move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect 
their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing 
sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily 
be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will 
realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.

It is not a bad model just a different one.

Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall 
Street.

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

  I agree with you that it's a lesson people need to learn
over and over again.  I can't tell you how many politicians
I met over the past year who really don't like markets and
certainly don't understand how or why they work.  These
aren't just the minor leaguers in Sacramento, but the big
league players in Washington.

  I also agree that the academic community can play ""an important
role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of
deregulation process.""  I'd like to think that is in large

Sorry for the delay in responding.

As for initiatives.  I have a VERY tentative product roadmap that plots the

far.

Keep in mind that anything past V2.0 is a pure WAG.  Also, if you have any
questions about any of the specific features, just let me know and I'll try
to explain.

Also keep in mind that the name so companies mentioned for the integration
pieces is only tentative.  These are companies we are working with but have

I would like the following sentences added under the  I. Pilot Meter and
Meter Add-on Ownership Program.

""Customer ownership of meters and add-ons reduces the cost of new facilities
through the avoidance of the tax gross-up on contributions in aid of
construction.  This can be a significant dollar amount for large
interconnections which require special facilities which are paid by the
requesting customer.""

Please insert this between the 2nd and 3rd full sentences of the first
paragraph.  With this change, I do not think any additional testimony needs
to be filed on the meter issues.  This is the same approach in the PG&E
settlement and is not a Norm or Turn or Longbeach issue.  Any opposition can
be addressed in rebuttal.

Here's the latest I've heard on our request for a new counterparty name 
(Sierra Pacific Holding Co.) to be added to EnPower. I faxed the master 
agreement to Melissa Murphy so the Confirms group could reference it; then 
she passed the pertinent information along to Samuel Schott in Global 
Counterparty, whose job it is to set up new counterparties. But it looks like 
your contact at Sierra is saying this deal should be done with Sierra Pacific 
Industries - the parent company - rather than Sierra Pacific Holding Co. 

Do you have a preference either way? Maybe you could contact Bob Ellery and 
discuss this. Just let me know which name to add to the deal.

Thanks,

Right now just trying to push through some basic mid mkt deals this (with hopes and expectations of closing Sato as well).  More structured transactions to follow (with real MTM value for EJ).  On 24/7 will come back to you.  Initially we were shut down on concept of George in Yen.  Will resurect this.  Also are going to want to push basic JCC.  We have developed (with some basic help from Research) projected forward curves for JCC.  We have also developed internally a system to ""help"" the traders delta hedge the position.

Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to
balance my commitments here.

Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members
while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition. We are
definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the
members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual
members could see way to convert to proprietary tools. The work that Shijie
Deng and Rajnish Kamat have been doing with me are good examples.

As to my trip, thanks for the invitation but I already committed myself to
get back Friday night so I will save my visit for another time.

I will tell my son about the spring interviews at Cornell. Hopefully this
time he will not miss it.

In answer to your phone message I am sending you the following information.

There is one thing you probably need to be aware of.  On the Research
list, Elena Chilkina is shown as an Analyst P/T, however, in the records she
is shown as an ""Adm Coord"".  This was done so that she could be considered
non-exempt and receive overtime.  However, her actual job is an analyst.

Also, Roman Zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months
ago, but was never moved to the new group.  He is now up for rotation again

Have you or a member of your group had a chance to look over the forwarded e-mail yet?  We have a meeting on Thursday with another potential client who plans to use his own capital.  His capital budgeting issues are similar to those of the client who prompted my original e-mail.

The more DSM projects that we can help the client get approved, the more DSM savings we can share with the client.  These DSM projects can turn a retail commodity contract with low profitability into a substantially more profitable contract for us.

I am concerned about the recent accounting around the wind hedge (and not necessarlily the outcome in this particular case!).  If the outcome had been reversed (ie. a loss on the hedges existed) we would have had no choice but to book it.  The issue is that nobody commmunicated or documented the designation of these positions as hedges of the ""wind"" PPA.  It occurs to me that we do not have any process that requires coodination when you set up an accrual book. As you know the designation criteria are rigid for acctg purposes.  If we miss it, we can't cure it and the acctg would be MTM for the life of the contracts.  I will set a metting to discuss.

<9867280.1075859392446.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Mark and Jeff: There is an impression circulating among some of the commercial teams that their compensation may be directly linked to asset dispositions, ie. success fees.  Apparently, this may have started due to ""rumors"" that the London Receiver is allowing for such paymentsfor example, the pending Arcos turbine sale.  This is unsubstantiated, but may be worthy of inquiry.  Accordingly, in at least one domestic example, it is my understanding that the deal team was fairly unmotivated until they heard about the London ""arrangement"" and are now pursuing with great exuberance.  Maybe this is a good thing, but clearly an arrangement that needs to be vetted and then communicated so people understand what the ""rules"" may be.

The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity 
numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers 
from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the 
transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers 
much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly 
disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if 
you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy

Tim Belden forwarded to me the files shown below for ""soft targets for Q1.""  It appears these reports are to track Middle Market transactions company wide.  However, the data does not match our records.  Attached is a recent report indicating Portland Middle Market year to date earnings of about $27 million and 163 transactions.  We also have the Services Desk here in Portland run by Greg Wolfe that is up an additional $3 million or so year to date. Can you give me the name of an individual who is involved with the reports below so I can contact them and figure out why our numbers differ from those in the reports below?

Just thought of saying hi since it has been an long  time.  How's everything in Houston?  Things in banking are slowing  down.  I'm just hoping that this project I'm staffed on will go live.   There is a 90% chance.  Most activity now in Asia is M&A related.   You see cross-border deals happening, i.e. Europe into Asia and Asia into the  U.S.  High yield and convertibles appear to be rocketing.  I've  encountered a couple of personalities at Lehman but so far things are  okay.    Just got the bonus and so I'm thinking where to park the  money.  Maybe I'll invest it in power technology since California  lacks electricity.  Who knows.  
 
I heard from Jens that you moved to Enron Online.  Jens got a great  vacation in Cuba.  I wish I could have joined him.
Well, that's all for now.

We had 2 service outages today, the External Internet and Email both became unavailable at about 11:00 am today, service was restored in after about 15-20 minutes.  The fact that both services went down at the same time is only coincidence.

Below are the basic causes for the outages:

The Internet outage was caused by an error in one of our Network Routers.  The device was rebooted and service was restored.

The Email outage was caused by a bug in Exchange that is remedied by rebooting the server.

<20116146.1075840579315.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"John,

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar Days ( Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Let me know if this helps.

I hope its going well!

I just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades.  Could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart?  It would be my  preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions.  The risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible.

Please give me a call to discuss.

<17388357.1075845347589.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I'm looking at the GDP-HEHUB curve shift details, and it has a current price of 0, and prior price of 4.151 for August. Position manager's getting this from the deal aggregator, which grabs it from ERMS. It appears to be using the mid price off of deals. So if we look at post ID 1159936, deal Q29897.2, we have GDP-HEHUB for the pub code, and 4.151 as the mid price for August. My question for you fine gentlemen is, where should it be pulling the prior day curve value? Should I just hit egscurves, and insert the value from there?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

I'm still very concerned about the NJ aspect of things - I was under the impression we are not going physical until 2003 in NJ.  Rebecca - can you confirm this for me?  If we are indeed continuing onward with this direct marketing campaign (and it is for a physical product) is everyone on the business side (back office) in on the loop?

Otherwise, I will take a look at ME - Richard - I presume the cost again came from the same type of calculations that you threw together for Mass?  Sandy - what changes should I make to our current label overall (not necessarily for the Direct Mini) based upon your research that still apply to our current customers?

 After discussing the performance of True Quote with Mike Guadarrama I am increasingly concerned that they have problems which may take some time to overcome.  Mike believes that the speed issue is a result of the way they have designed their architecture.  If this is the case we will not see improved performance for some time.  

I've asked Mike to have a conversation with the True Quote developer to give us a better idea of what he believes the root problems are.  Based upon Mike's assessment we can get a feel of the time it may take to correct the problems.

We continue to spend a great deal of time testing with True Quote and this is consuming a fair amount of time for the testing team.",negative

I have indicated the kinds of adjustments from the PJM platform necessary to make it work.  I don't think is necessary to take a swing at Mark Mayer of BPA to make our point that LMP will work.  Mark was caught flat footed and unprepared for Dick O'Niell's cheap shot.  Second, the proportion of hydro and the mix of other units is quite different in PJM and NYISO, so the fact that they fit hydro in around the edges is not necessarily proof that it will work in the PNW.  For that reason, I have noted the mix of units (hydro and base load) to show that the unit committment process will be different but you can still produce hourly prices.

<7891791.1075840448711.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Gentlemen,

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of 
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having 
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence by 
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In 
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each 
turbine ID and status message.  

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status 
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be 
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in 
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

We have received the original copy of the ISDA Master Agreement.  In looking through the supporting documents, we noted two outstanding items:

1.	We did not receive an original signed IRS Tax Form W-9 as required pursuant to Part 3(a); and

2.	The Certificate of Incumbency we received was not an original and was dated November 14, 2000.  We would like to receive an original certificate dated a current date.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact either Frank or me.  We look forward to receiving this documentation.

I don't know if you remember me or not, I went to UT and was a good
friend of Stephanie Spence.  I know I met you at one of her showers or
maybe as late has her wedding.  Anyway, several people have told me that
you work here so I thought that I would say hello.

How long have you worked here?  What do you do?  Do you like it?  I'm on
the 25th floor with Net Works.  I started in January and so far I like
it.  I'm still trying to get used to my job and Houston in general.

Well, I just wanted to let you know I'm here.  Talk to you later.

There will be a story in tomorrow's Financial Times about our trading position in Europe. Myself and John Sherriff spoke with London-based FT reporter Andy Taylor.

Andy is a long-standing contact and an Enron supporter. He spoke with various players in the European market and although they were supportive, they were also giving the impression that business with Enron had dropped 90%. 

This is not the case and it was therefore important to refute this. I'm comfortable with how the interview went. John made a point of saying how supportive counterparties had been and we did not discuss anything beyond our European trading position.

Will forward the coverage tomorrow.

Hope all is well and that you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving.

following items of note were revised.

1.  Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty.  
Enron will only provide a payment guaranty.  Enron does not have the means to 
ensure performance by the LLC.  Thus the language needs to clearly identify 
that this is a payment guaranty.  As long as Transco gets paid for the 
transport, I am not sure why this matters.

2.  Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their 
tariff.  Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the 
ability to recover double interest on late payments.  Thus, the interest 
language in the guaranty was removed.  

Please review the revised guaranty.  I would be happy to discuss these issues

When you have some time, can we get together on the circumstances under which 
we should charge a business unit for the addition of a new Product Type?

I'm thinking specifically of the units which do receive a cost allocation, 
but are adding products which in our opinion are of questionable economic 
benefit.

These could be charged in accordance with our current price schedule. i.e. 
new Product Types added to existing businesses could be charged the 
incremental setup fees.  New Businesses would be the 250K.

If the Product Type is of clear benefit (e.g. Options for US Gas and for the 
guys we are training this week), then the costs would be part of next year's 
allocation.

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

I need to know where crude/liquids financial trades for  Valero should be 
traded under.    I was reading the comments on Lotus Notes, and it seems that 
there was an assignment from Valero Gas Marketing L.P. to Valero Marketing & 
Supply Company;  then it seems that the natural gas financial  trades were 
assigned to PG&E.   Can you please check on this.  If the information on 
Lotus Notes is correct please change the ""Executed Master Agreeements"" list 
to read Valero Marketing & Supply Company (for crude/liquids trades).  
Currently the list reads Valero Gas Marketing L.P.

Thanks for your assistance,

In response to your questions:

#1:  legal is fine.  done.
#2:  I'm fine w/that also.  Its basically saying the same thing as the ISDA.  
done.
#3:  I'm fine w/excluding the Joint Powers Agency (take or pay contracts) 
that cp may have.  done.  I don't recall them excluding it from the ISDA 
though...may want to verify and ask them of that.
#4:  I'm fine w/posting of 10days...as long as its on a bilateral basis.  I 
thought the ISDA accomplished that...but I may have misread it to apply to 
all margin calls similar to SMUD doing so.  Carol, can we have it apply to

This is the latest skew calculator file.  It has a sheet for the vol skew table, and it calculates the ENA pdf using a linear interpolation between points on the table, not a polynomial.  

The file shows yesterday's settle data for Jun, and ENA data matches very well.  (All the 2001 contracts agree closely with ENA data from yesterday, in fact.)  I've added a macro that fetches the underlying price, volatility, and interest rate from our in-house EGSPROD32 database.  Let me know if this doesn't work for you.

Feel free to contact any of us if you have any questions or requests regarding this file.  hope it is helpful.

the post id. (It appears that it is only the PRC book that comes through, the

Since the Canadian post id only includes two books ids,  the Benchmark group 
manually assign the same post id to the basis book, that way both books get

I am going to be joining the Enron Associate Class of February 2002(from The
University of Chicago).

Sir, I have a question.  I was wondering what your thoughts might be regarding
the creation of an operation to trade interest rate products?  I am certain
that yield curve exposure is a significant source of risk that certain areas of
Enron must already be addressing.  However, to the best of my knowledge,  I
don't think Enron actually trades interest rate products?

If there is any interest in doing so, I would be very pleased to offer my time
to assist in researching the potential feasibility and profitability while
still a student, and before I report to Enron.

I just talked to my friend Curtis Press and he said to have you give him
a call about Annie and Vegas.  From what I know he is a very good vet.
He will also definitely let you know if the surgery makes sense (for
Annie) and who he thinks should do the surgery, etc.

He works most days at the Mission Valley Pet hospital in San Francisco.
The phone number there is 552-1969.  He and his wife also own a pet
hospital in Larkspur.

Hope all's well and Edison's paying you.  

Please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up 
on filings like these in California prior to filing.

As you know, it's crazy in California, with a lot flying around in numerous 
forums.  Even Ken Lay's frequently been to California over the past couple of 
months trying to educate and advocate rational, detailed solutions.  Want to 
make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to 
get this ridiculous state back on track.

Not trying to slow you down, or dictate content; rather, given the 
high-stakes nature of the California situation, coordination is critical.  
Thanks much.

1. More Government isn't the answer.  If this proves anything, it is that 
Government is the wrong party to manage consumer's energy price risk.

3. Direct Access is a better solution for California.  Let businesses manage 
their own needs, rather than a small public agency never designed to take on 
this task.

4. Too much, too late.  CDWR should have been buying to manage the cost for 
2001, not worrying about 2007.  Any contract that starts after Sept 2002 is 
simply not a part of any real solution.

By the way, I think that if pressed, Enron has to be very clear - we are not

I am just back in my office and I would thank you for any information and 
offer.
In the next 4 weeks the Minister of Industry must complete the restructuring 
of the
Italian electricity system and for the new year the Independent System 
operator -
the Pool - and the Single Buyer must start (tentative date).
We really need any professional help we will be able to find and I believe I 
will
contact you very soon. In the main time I will be in touch with Professor
Borenstein (to which I am sending the same e-mail) and his Institute that I 
would

have a Friday deadline that is fast approaching.  We have a call with the San 
Diego team tomorrow and I would like to have an update ready for them.  
Please page me at 888-766-4103 to give me an update.

Not sure if you were aware of 2 items that Jennifer passed on to me:  1.)  We 
as EES have recently signed a confidentiality agreement with Sony.  2.)  
Sony's web site has alot of financial numbers (I don't know if they are 
broken-out).

Also, we are preparing for alternative S-T solutions.  How many months are 
you willing to allow at this point (we are coming off a 4 month deal) and if 
we do a PX plus basis deal (reduced market exposure) does that change our 
position at all?",neutral

I have no way of being able to discuss cost implications of changing the
post card language, since I do not know the current costs and have not
reviewed the ERCOT contract for the customer care center.  Prior to the
meeting, could someone at ERCOT forward that information including a break
out for the mailing cost and also invite a person from the subcontractor to
prepare estimates on the costs associated with the changes (such as going to
a larger card or envelope to assure that customers get all the necessary
information to make an informed decision)?

Also, could we begin at 2 instead of 1?   Three hours should be more than
adequate and the time conflicts with another PUC/Gov. office function.

to have control in it's growth and staffing, although it would be coordinated
with Thor.  Mark (and I) talked to Thor about this a while ago, and will

products, and growing this business continentally.  (Mark was still concerned
about the members of the Oslo weather group that Thor managed poorlyin

I got your e-mail just fine.  Is your computer fixed up now?  

Cole had a great time at his birthday party last night.  When we were walking 
out of Chuck E Cheese after the party, Cole asked me ""Daddy, am I three 
now?""  He got some good presents and got to play alot of games.  It took him 
forever to go to sleep.  He really loved the Blues Clues game ya'll got him.  
The packaging was coming open when he got it yesterday, so Tonya let him open 
it before the party.  He played it in the car going to the party and on the 
way home.  I think I'm tired of that game.  He can't play it in the car 
anymore.  It so funny to watch him play though.  He will repeat the question

We were able to get comfortable to cross into Canada on the PGE transactions, but there were extra matters that had to be handled in respect of Canada/US tax issues.

I don't mind working for a few more years.. just don't want it to be 20 more.

I don't think I will be in Denver that early.... What's going on?

Calgary, Who knows????? 

Stock meltdown is a long story... perhaps a bit more rumor than fact but that doesn't matter much at this moment.. we are in preservation mode right now.... but I believe things will be fine. All in all we have had the best year ever, the street just hated the way we set up some of our off balance sheet vehicles because they created conflict of interest...time will tell who is correct.

Could you please fed ex it to Peter Thompson at A&K in DC.  Peter, could you 
please give Suzanne the information of where to send it.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share
your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more of
a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of
Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble
deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and
settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative
processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of
working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available
opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,

draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the PD is 
misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state, and why our 
settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state.  
The letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement.  It needs

 - clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them;
 - geographical clustering;
 - flexibility in choosing ""core curves"" (based on position size);
2. Jump-diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month:
 - parameter estimation from historical data (do we want to use it?)

Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that 
California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.

meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on 
the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.  She stated 
at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to 
place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.  Economists in the room 
expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly 
focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.  Not sure where it 
will go, but wanted to pass it along.

that the TW IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist.  
However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.  First, does ""voluntary"" 
mean filing a proposal with FERC is also voluntary?  Or is the Commission 
here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with 
auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on

used to be IT.
It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A

allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated 
us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they

After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.

risk for November.  [For your information but not for the filing - We have a 
big position for November so we need to get this pushed off until December or 
we could lose alot of money].
By basing the caps on heat rates from 1999, the ISO assumed that this was the

Assuming units #761 and #762 are now assigned to LEC-10"" service, the below schematic is showing the capacity of the three remaining units #822, #842 and #845 at Atoka-3.

At suction pressure of 225 psig and discharge pressure of 560 psig the capacity is 36 mmcf/d.  






The 36 mmcf/d is not a fixed capacity, if discharge pressure increases the capacity decreases. Basically it depends on the volume activities between Atoka-3 and Atoka-1 such as BP, Rio Pecos and GPM.

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

<26856714.1075842980268.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I read the attached plan.  What concerns me is that PG&E is proposing to 
penalize customers for failing to curtail during Stage 3 conditions.  This 
may be detrimental to EESI to the extent the customer does not curtail and 
EESI is expected to cover the cost of the penalties per our contract with the 
customer.  This penalty is unacceptable if we are expected by the customer to 
pay the penalties.  The plan does provide for putting the customer in a 
Rotating Outage queue
if the customers fails to curtail on two occassions.  In my opinion, there 
should not be any financial penalties and instead the customer is switched 
immediately to a Rotating Outage queue if the customer fails to curtail.  The 
customer option to ""buy through"" may financially harm us.  Dennis, any

worst case scenario information from our SEC filing .  We can probably expect 
more articles like this during December.  Our reactive media statement on

All counterparties with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the position out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk book (the book on the online product).  This applies only to finanical swaps and not physical deals.

Please let me know if there is going to be a change and if so what the deals should look like in Tagg.  The programmers need time to modify logic and I need time to test!

I have provided the additional questionnaire which we sent to our European 
counsel with respect to trading in Bandwidth capacity. You may wish to 
provide this to your counsel as a basis for the questionnaire regarding the 
physical trading of Bandwidth capacity. Please note that one of the key 
issues may be the location of the respective geographical points for each 
Bandwidth transaction. We would anticipate that there would be fewer issues 
or none at all where a particular counterparty wishes to trade in Bandwidth 
capacity where the two respective geographical points are not located in 
their jurisdiction. (ie. A German counterparty trading Bandwidth from 
Brussels to Paris)

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.

Some options:

1.   Capitalize as software development cost and amortize at FERC approved rate of 4.4% to DD&A. (The implied amortization period is substantially longer than the expected useful life of the software).

2.  Capitalize as software development cost and amortize using Corporate Standard rate of 20% to DD&A.  (Would not want to have this rate applied to all of our other unamortized software development costs).

3.  Hold balance in deferred debits (as deferred O&M) and amortize to Marketing O&M expense over the 5 year useful life of the project (per project economics).  This approach is similar to the way we handled the deferred costs (mainly AA charges) associated with the Operation Information project about 4 1/2 years ago.",neutral

We have a few problems with deals with EES.  We have tried to get them 
straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.  
Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and 
they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.

Deal #481619 should be $145.00 even.  The trader says the deal was done 
direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge

Deal # 480433 should be killed.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for 
the same hours.  This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount

Sean sat down with Christian and I and explained his proposed product.  Theproduct works like this:  EPMI and a counterparty agree on a day-ahead basis to a quantity of power, a price for that power, a delivery point, and the hours at which the power will be scheduled.  The seller does not schedulethe power as a day-ahead schedule, however.  Instead, the supplier schedules the power on a real time basis on the day of delivery.

We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  

AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms

Attached are a clean copy of suggested modification of the body of this DASH as well as a copy of the original DASH.  This should give you some sense of the Arcos project's scale and risks.  John Sherriff and Michael Brown reportedly remain confident that this can be sold at a profit in the next three to nine months; however, if it is not, our economics on this project with a current termination cost of over $200 million is a negative NPV of approximately ($150 million).  The Enron board has not seen this, largely because the turbine cost is not specifically related to this project, but no other use of the turbines has been identified, so this project represents a huge potential loss if the sale is not successful.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.

FYI,  I just spoke with Mark Frevert's assistant, and she has informed me 
that today is the only day he will be in the office this week.  There is a 
slight possibility that he will be in on Friday for a small amount of time.  
He will be going on vacation to the Virgin Islands for the next two weeks.  I 
was also told it will be highly unlikely that he will have faxing 
capabilities.  I just wanted to give you all a heads-up, just in case you 
might foresee the need for his signature in the near future.  Thank you for 
your attention to this matter.

whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name to 
yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees 
that may apply).   I don't know how it would work; maybe he could conference 
you in when he makes the calls.  For what it is worth, he is a very nice guy 
to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't care one way or 
the other. 

Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it, 
in case you were wondering.  I will take care of it (it looks pretty clean 
anyway!).  

Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund 
next week.

Thanks for the email.  I'm sure Paul has spoken to you by now.... but, Paul 
has sold 100% of this gas based on a Questar price for the entire month of 
November.  So, we [Entrada/Crescendo] will be receiving the IF Questar flat 
price no matter what pipe it flows on for November.  So, for November, it 
doesn't matter to me how you flow the gas, as long as it flows.  If moving 
this gas to NWPL helps you guys and doesn't cut into 100% of their gas 
flowing, then I suppose you can do what you see fit.

 three Topock points listed, has a capacity of 400 MDth/d.  Additionally,
 the mainline capacity going west, which serves ALL of our markets in

I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of 
Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14"" monitors 
per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.  Will 
try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, 
attractive look.    

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve 
Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs 
are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, 
non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have 
a 3 month implementation schedule.

credit support for MG and PaperCo.

My approach is as follows:

1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.
2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.
3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the 
default option)  using Black's formula.
4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is 
treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back 
this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced 
rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two 
NPV's.

whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale 
businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.  
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this

<28604266.1075840848677.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Louise, need to ask a question for clarification.  TBG is ready to sign.  The settlement is structured to change the transaction beginning Nov 1.  If we delay, they may revert in Nov to operating and scheduling volumes according to the existing agreement and not the settlement agreement, which is bad for ENA.  A bit of a balancing act but I think that I have it under control.  My question is this.  Can I move forward with the execution of the Settlement IF the payment is not required until Nov 30 ?  I am sorry and I may be splitting hairs, but don't want this to slip away.  If I need to hold off on everything I will do what is needed.

The TD/ENA commodity swap has language regarding ""loan repayment"" and the

administrative burden on Enron that currently does not exist.  Section (b) is 
acceptable.

2.  Paragraph 3 - Changes are acceptable.

3.  Paragraph 4 -  Changes in this section are acceptable, however, it is

know, in addition to his work for EBS in Europe, Jan has been spending 
considerable time directing EBS' government affairs work in Asia.   Due in

As per our conversation yesterday, I suggest that we put the two trades that you closed with us in January (25 MW baseload swap, 1 year, Feb. 01 to Jan 02) back on the MTM books and give you simultaneously the opportunity to close these positions.  Our prices for  June 01 - Jan 02 swap rates are as follows:

Argentina power $18.50 - $20.40 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in US dollars; you are currently long)
Brazil power R$425 - R$475 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in reais; you are currently short);

former is important because Enron is adapting the new business model in 
Brazil and it's not very well understood there.   The latter was presented in

van Ulden participating on the advisory board I would have a few cautions.
It should not include any hard commitments from Enron in terms of funding.  
We may want to participate in the program but we should not be required too.
His compensation should be insignificant or nothing.  Otherwise he would have 
a conflict as their revenues will come from our competitors.  I would have a 
lot of heartburn over that as an Enron representative as well as if I came 
from the competition.

Thanks for the quick response.  Yes, working in Europe has been a good

However, I'm probably not going to consult in 2002.  Not exactly my ""cup of

For what it is worth, I believe this move, although very unfortunate given Andy's long service to Enron, is the right thing to do. In the way that Enron has historically been the poster child for corporate innovation, I hope you will now lead us in the direction that makes us the poster child for handling a crisis of investor confidence. Enron is such an amazing company, I trust you will do everything necessary to work cooperatively with the investor community to restore the company to its former greatness.

<17500089.1075842514741.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.  DF",negative

""Based on the evidence and arguments presented regarding open access transmission tariff, pilot-project participation, wholesale and retail system readiness, and independence issues, the Commission finds that the area of Texas located within the SPP is unable to offer fair competition and reliable services to all customer classes on January 1, 2002"" ...

Hi. Hope things are going well for you in Europe. I was going through some old emails and ran across this one and thought I'd drop you a line. How is the family settling in and how is the job going? Things are fine here. I turned down a job with UBS and am waiting for my contract to expire. I will be glad when this whole Enron chapter is closed in my life. I'm sure everyone will. Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know how things are going for you. Take care.

Felipe, as we discussed on the phone, try talking with netnames and see what 
they say.  I think, if it's easy to do both, then we could use the second one 
as a matter of course, but I don't think it's an issue: registering a domain 
namea simple process, sometimesis not the same as creating contracts and 
trading off thema much more complicated effort.  (Cyber squatters, for 
example, aren't even the legal corporations whose domains they carry.)

Thanks for thinking about it, though!  (And if it all goes wrong I'm sending

While Enron's management teams are reviewing actions plans for the upcoming six to nine months, I understand that functional transition teams will be assembled to address the planned merger.  I would like to register my strong interest in assisting any transition team where my skills could add value. Prior to developing and supporting corporate as well as enterprise systems at Enron my career has spanned across General Electric Capital Services and ABB on a global basis. Much of this experience has included system integration and change management.  

Let me know if you have any questions to the above.  Otherwise, I wanted to let you know of my interest and desire in working towards a successful transition for Enron.

Thanks for the reply.  Your thoughts on the EEI draft in terms of details would be helpful.  As I read it, we still have the problems with the EEI draft that we had with the NERC draft on which it is based  deference, regional rules variances, regional reliability entities, regional advisory boards, limits on FERC authority, etc., etc.  It would also be helpful to have input on whether the plans for EISB could go forward if legislation like the EEI bill were enacted into law.

Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's ""supplemental"" PHC statement reads:

""It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission.""

donation to me before 4:30 p.m. today.  We have decided to donate the money 
in memory of his Grandmother to the nursing home she had lived in for the 
past 3 years.  I will also be filling out the form for Enron's Gift Matching 
Program.  A small portion of the money will be for a plaque for Bob that will 
be engraved with language regarding our donation.    Bob does not know about 
this!  I will get the plaque over the weekend and we can present it to Bob 
sometime next week.
