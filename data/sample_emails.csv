I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition of Spot Market
Service which says ""and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical corporation to
provide retail electric service"" which seems to me to go way beyond even energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara

The proposed timeline at the bottom of the page shows that 'Imbalance Trading Ends' on the 16th calendar day of the month.

GISB Standard 2.3.41 states that imbalance trading should be allowed through at least the 17th business day of the month.  The language of the standard is as follows:

""Standard 2.3.41 -- Transportation Service Providers should provide the ability to post and trade imbalances until at least the close of the seventeenth business day of the month.""

This timing will need to be incorporated into the timeline.

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to 
determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from 
Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily, 
Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily 
decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the 
curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.

You had suggested some ""wholesalers"" and utilities the conference and I don't
know which if any are pure generating companies.  Would you say that SCE and
PG&E suffer from high prices and therefore support price caps?  We're thinking
of Bryson and Glynn and I want to make sure someone can speak to the issue of
price caps scaring away investment.  Would Southern and Reliant fit this bill?

Thanks a ton.  Sorry that the school's fundraiser called, I hope that didn't
bother you.

on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to

C- 

The Schedule M I sent the group yesterday is the one that contains mine and 
Pat's revisions. I will attach it again for ease of reference. 



The one we did for City of Azusa is based on the revised form above except 
that we plugged in the relevant Act relating to City of Azusa as well as 
their funds. Also - Azusa did not want to get an external legal opinion so we 
changed that in their Schedule M. Otherwise though, the Schedule M w/ them is 
identical to the revised Schedule M above. Having said that - you are 
certainly welcome to see the Schedule M we signed with City of Azusa and here 
it is:



Take care,

Please review my comments, attached.  I discussed this matter with our 
outside counsel, and it is his belief that, since Dennis is testifying on 
personal knowledge to rebut the Universities' specualtion about our ""windfall 
profits,""  we do not need all of the specific info about amounts of losses 
and exposure, but can be more general.  I have attempted to address that with 
the attached changes, which I hope will be easier for everyone to get 
comfortable with. 

Once we get this where we like it, I am going to walk it around to Dan and 
others on the commercial side to make sure everyone is comfortable.  Peggy, I 
will leave PR and IR to you.

Subject: Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach/Air Permitting Update 


    Kay, Steve, Ben, and Debbie --  
        I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP is
intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings into
a single proceeding.  To that end,  Martha believes that the proceedings
should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the cases
is consolidated into the other.  Martha believes that consolidation is
appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are
consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the sites
as one.   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted our
position on the proposed consolidation.  I told her that we would likely
oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing our
position.  
        Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages.    The cases, if
consolidated, may be less expensive to try.  Yet, the hearing in December
may be at risk if consolidation occurs.    In addition, the parties are not
exactly the same in each proceeding  (Margate is not a participant in the
Deerfield proceeding).  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible
with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation.   If she does not hear
back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate that
Enron objects to the consolidation.    
         Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enron's response to
DEP's Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit.   I promised not
to file any response last week, given the pending settlement negotiations
but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days. 
         Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation.  
            --Kerri    .

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

How are you?  I haven't quite melted yet, but I am coming close. It has been very hot here, but I know I can't expect to get any sympathy from someone who lives in Texas.

Thank you for thinking of me in regards to Sen. Schumer's fundraising.  What is his fundraiser's name?  I may know her or of her at least.  The political fundraising world is pretty small.

I am not sure what to make of the sunglasses comment because via email I can't tell if you were joking or serious.  But in either case, the answer is no.

Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my ""career"" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to ""shape and 
mold them"" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before ""hope springs eternal"".

Talk to you soon,

weekend, April 13 at Kathy's house.  Does that date
still work for everyone?  Let us know soon so we can
start making plans.

Talk to you soon.
Angela

P.S. for Chris - If you think you can come for one of
the weekends, you should choose Stacey's shower - it
won't hurt my feelings!  :)

I know that we cannot move all the Service Groups, but you had agreed that we could move all the E&C Employees in Jerry Martin's organization to 1202 and a number of the Ops. Support Services Employees (in Morris's organization) that support all of the pipelines and are NOT mostly dedicated to just one company.

Please confirm so we can work with HR to have these employees moved at year end.

Also, have there been any further updates from regulatory regarding a more encompassing move of employees to one service company?

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility)

Is the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?

Thanks,

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Good Afternoon,

Here are my findings for the latest Release of the PSW and Path Conf. I am re-running the date of June 22, as I see no data in the path confirmation for that date.

PreSchedule Workspace:

I tried to open the sheet ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  and got this error ""Access violation at address 00000016. Read of address 00000016.  I could not save, close or do anything, I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW.  I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet, and had closed the COB sheet. When I re-opened the ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  sheet, it was completely blank.  This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet. 

Error checking
The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal (#657854.1) that was put in the market deal number area. It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buy/resale.  This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present, but the routing error check mentioned it in rows 69-192, where the deal number was not present. Can the sheet be made to understand that a buy/resale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell?

I also got just ""Error:"" with no explanation of what the error was for rows 3-6, 9-11 and 21-28.  Rows 3-6  and 9-11, has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream, both identified as Portland General System on the sheet. Rows 21-28 I see no errors apparent. 

My second PV sheet gave me  routing error  ""Error:""  with no explanation on rows 2-45.  The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export.  I changed all rows to X, and still got the routing error with no explanation.  I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection. Could it be that the system already detects routes?

 << File: PV_JUNE22_LIMITED.psc >> 



Path Confirmation:

The Transmission information seems to be populating correctly, all trans looks good and has the -E- on each side. I can put my POR/POD info in the Oasis cell, and all the info looks great!
The Global ID Sorting is working just right.
The Tag Sorting is also working just right.
The expanded view is showing the entire path regardless of length.
I like the POR and POD sort capability, this will be very helpful.

In the Expanded View,  even though I know the counterparty, this view sometimes shows me a blank drop down box where the counterparty should be. Allegheney did not show a counterparty name here. This actually looks like it might be specific to Allegheney.

In the line view My counterparty on the sheet CPS shows Constellation Power Source, Inc.  but in the expanded view I see City Public Service of San Antonio. They both have CPS as their short name, but the second counterparty is an East Desk Counterparty. Corry, Can you get their short name changed to something else you like?

Path Cut:

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for.  I only want to see the following:  California   Northwest   WSCC-N   WSCC-S  Rockies.  If I need to provide more explanation on this, I am happy to do so. The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete, and will be cumbersome for real-time and settlements to use.  These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done.

Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done, just over a minute. Users will percieve this as something broken.

I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut, I will hand this off to them very soon.  



Overall Findings:

I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production.  We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue, but the functionality looks really good.  My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from ""X"" date previous the records are in lotus, and from ""X"" date forward they are in the new system. Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both.

Please let me know anything else that I need to do, and when I may test again.  Thanks

Carol - I have reviewed the changes in both forms attached.  In the LOC, I 
think that they are getting at the point to allow for partial drawings and 
requesting to reduce the auto renewal notice clause to 30 days from 90 days.  
Seems okay to me.  The proposed changes in the Letter of Credit Provisions, 
please ignore.  I have discussed this with them and they have come off it.

been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones

In the Senate:
After Burton's ""proclamation"" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was ""all Edison was getting, period,"" the bill was voted down in committee and never made it to the full Senate for a vote.
The bill will be ""reconsidered"" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same committee.  

In the Assembly:
Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched his vote and let it get out.
82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning.
83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted out of committee and will go to appropriations today.

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of the bill"" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Jeff",545,"The wierdness continues.....

I last spoke with John Neuffer about his meetings with the Japanese side on15 June just prior to completion of the Fourth Joint Status report releasedon June 30. I attach a copy of the joint status report for your reference. I
also attach recent copies of the weekly political updates we have been
preparing for internal consumption. The most recent report contains an
overview of the new structure of the bilateral deregulation talks.





      

It would be good if we could talk prior to the meeting so that I can give you
feedback on my discussions with John and an update of what is currently
happening in Japan. When would you be available to talk?

We have not met, but I want to thank you for the letter you sent to all
employees re: Sept. 11.

I am a still-new employee (1+ years) of Portland General Electric (a
wholly owned electric utility subsidiary :-), but I want to tell you
how proud I am of being a member of a team so dedicated to doing its
best at all times -- even in the absolute worst of times, as we've
experienced in the last month.

I only hope that if PGE must leave the Enron family, we will be able to
maintain the same high level of respect and integrity we've achieved to
date. I am proud to be an Enron/PGE employee.

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Mr. Taylor:
Here are the emissions data files from the appropriate State Summary
Files for the years 1997, 1998, 1999.  The attached files are in Excel
v. 5 format.  If Excel v. 5 format is not acceptable I will be able to
send them to you in ASCII.TXT, comma-delimited, first row of data used

described format.  This data is just for the TNRCC account numbers
supplied in your request.  

Please let me know if this data is acceptable.  There is no charge for
this data because it is not the entire State Summary File for each year.


I want to thank you for typing the account numbers.  This saves me

Jim,

I wanted to know how I would find this data.  I am looking for the NOx
emissions for the accounts below for 1997-2000.  I have some of the data
for 1999, and very little for 2000.  How do I find the rest of the data?
Website?  Database?  I believe you sent me the state database in August
which included some 1999 and 2000 numbers for the accounts below.  I
suppose some more accounts may have been updated for 2000.

Subject: RE: TNRCC State Summary File


Mr. Taylor:
1)  The allowable data is generally unique to each permit.  Because of
this a general statement like ""the allowable tons/year for SO2 in Harris
County is ......."" would not be defendable or valid.  
2)  I believe that the allowable data varies in relation to the season
of year and part of the state - a.k.a., ""ambient background threshold"".
In other words, if it is ozone season, allowable emissions probably
would be lower.  
3)  The allowable emissions threshold is also variable over time.  25
years ago, Harris county probably did not need an allowable cap for
certain emissions.  As industry grows the allowable emissions will be
adjusted.  The period of time for the data to become outdated could be
as little as 1 month, depending on when new allowables or new permits
are initiated.  
4)  Texas charges corporations a ""tax"" for emissions over their
allowable limit.  It is sort of a pay-as-you-go plan.  Of course I am
being very simplistic here, but the point is still the same.  

Your questions are excellent and I am giving you as specific an answer
as possible.  I hope I am not being too pointed but to the data oriented
person, the previous points are important for data integrity.  Jim Parks

I absolutely agree with you about the panels the last two years -- they have been weak.  I think, though, that this should be looked at a little differently.  The purpose for this is to highlight the operations of our business and to showcase the next level of leadership.  I think rather than just focusing on one or two businesses, this format will allow us to hit each of them at a high level.  Mark will introduce each of you, talk a little about your backgrounds to help the VPs get familiar with our new leadership, and interject questions and generate discussion as appropriate.

Yes, partly.  I saw John last week and he told me that his wife was due to deliver their second child on November 9 and he would possibly miss the conference.  However, I know Mark was also interested in having women represented and liked having both you and Janet on the panel to balance things out.

Subject:	Management Conference - Business Unit Panel


Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Daren:
I am having trouble with 8/00.  The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at 
Fuels Cotton.  We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange 
deal 157288.  You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had 
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.  Since there was a 
spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.  Duke says that 
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at 
GD - 0.10.  The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.  Please let 
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be.  
The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/00.  Duke is telling 
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are 
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.  This 
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline 
shows all of the gas on the 7th.  This is a daily swing meter which 
electronically feeds into settlements.  We don't normally change these 
meters.  If you intended for us to prorate this gas, I will need your OK. The 
emails below are from Marta at Duke notifying us of the change.

Read information below and see if this helps one of the unresolved problems
for August.

 Megan can you tell me how you arrived at the price for August 1?  I do not
know why August 1 would be priced differently than the other days of the
month when we had over deliveries for the Fuel Cotton Valley gas.  This is
priced at HSC daily - .10 per paragraph 3 of the contract.  If a different
price was worked out with Darren, I do not have record of it.  Darren is
out until next week.

Please increase deliveries to Eastrans to 30,000 MMBtu/dy effective 8/4/00

The redeliveries will be:

7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley
22,200 to PG&E",710,"Megan, 

For 8/1/00, allocate the receipt of gas a Cotton Valley to the exchange 
deal.  Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement 
will occur at GD-.10.  Originally, we were working on a spot deal for this 
day.  Then, after the fact, we agreed to let the deal fall out under the 
exchagne deal.  I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket.

For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend.  Due to 
operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the 
deliveries on Monday.  I apologize for not getting this info to you earlier.

You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book deal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no problem re the confidentiality agreement. 
 
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years and have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building experiences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minister / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.
 
Please let me know when would be a good time to come by.

You have always told us that we can email at any time with comments or questions.

Employees are really getting worried about what's happened with our stock price.  It's not looking too good.  I know you and upper management are working hard to sort this out.  Please let us know what is really going on.  Rumors are flying about layoffs, bankruptcy, and takeovers.  All of our lives are affected.  People are trying to hang in here, but the future is too uncertain.  We are wondering whether to stay or bail out.

We need more answers.

Another comment which is constantly being made is that, ""It is not encouraging when we don't see upper management buying shares at these historically low prices"".   Any comments?

We did not give him any update or indication on where the output and heat rate numbers would be.

Subject: California Activities - UPDATE

Because so much is going on in California, I thought it would be important to 
draft up a list of current activities that Enron is active in or monitoring 
to make sure that everyone knows what is happening.  The following list of 
issues may not include everything.  If I've left something off that needs 
attention or someone is working on, please add it to the list.  

Thanks.

Subject:	FW: EOGIL sale to BG

Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  
1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)
2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.
3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. 
4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.
4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.
5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow ""form of agreement"".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening. 
6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?   

We'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.

If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.

With respect to the note below,  we have done the following this morning.  
1) We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review.  There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  

2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.

3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  

4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.

5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.

Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan.  The Creditor's Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations:
	1)  Escrow the proceeds
	2)  D&O insurance will be addressed in the future	
	3)  Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank.  Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.
	4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.  I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake.  ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.)
	
Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation.",1163,"Paula,  Tim Detmering talked with Jeff McMahon about this the other night, but Tim isn't in today so I don't know what they decided.

This means that the invoice will be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco		1,100,000 gallons
* San Juan Gas 	   210,000 gallons

<Embedded StdOleLink>",383,"If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

Subject:	ENE Form 10-Q Accounting Matter --  Initial Report

I understand that AA may not provide the review of interim financial information that the SEC requires to be obtained in respect of Form 10-Q filings ( Article 10 of Regulation SX).  Jordan asked me to give an update in an hour about the impact of this on covenants in ENE credit and other instruments requiring delivery of ENE's 10Qs.

(1)	I have not yet been able to ascertain whether (i) the AA review or any statement in respect thereof is required to be filed with the SEC, or (ii) if not so required, ENE would file the 10-Q without having obtained the review.  

(2)	ENE's 364-day corporate revolver (and most other ENE instruments containing the subject covenant) requires ENE to make available either on ""EDGAR"" or ENE's home page on World Wide Web, or otherwise make available to the Banks promptly after the filing or sending thereof, and in any event within 75 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters, a copy of ENE's report on Form 10-Q.  If ENE does not file the 10-Q, it arguably could nevertheless send it to the banks as confidential information (to comply with Regulation FD) within the required time period and satisfy the covenant.  The revolver contains a confidentiality provision.
Failure to deliver the 10-Q constitutes an Event of Default under the revolver if the failure continues for more than 30 days after ENE has received notice thereof by the Paying Agent.

I will continue to pursue information from the accountants.

Dear Guillermo,

WE ask that you be patient with us as we are affected by the recent changes
in the State of California.
Where we had an agreement with DWR, the governor. Mr. Davis, cancelled all
LOI contracts issued by DWR as of last Friday, we just learned this today.

However, for us, our IPP, we were given a new LOI this past Monday, good for
a week till next Monday, 27 Aug.,  and, it appeared our agreement was to be
with the new agency, Capa, ( Ca.Power Authority). Now, for our benefit, it
is back with DWR, and we have a PPA, in draft form, our developer is working
on with the State people. They, our dev., has been asked to stay in the
Capital till this is signed off on Monday which they are doing, staying!

I asked if we could get you a copy of this PPA but we can provide you with
the replacement LOI from DWR and we have requested the Draft PPA as well.

The moment the PPA is signed the funds will be wired to ENA, this we have as
a promise from the IPP and the Corporate Funding Group.

We have demonstrated our dilemma  and are doing the best we can.

Keep in mind that our IPP is the only one left to end up with a contract.
Ten others were not extended.

If you can see your way clear please give us until next week to provide the
funds without changing the end date of 28 Sept. Extend us one more week.

Your thoughtful understanding is greatly appreciated. Please feel free to
have Brett give us a call so we can personally bring him up to date.

We are doing everything we can to make our client aware of the need to
produce the funds  we have committed to and they have given us their
assurance that this will indeed be done at the moment of signing.

It's just that the State of Ca. really threw us for a loop with this new
agency and back and forth with DWR, and now we are  back on board as
originally intended.. Just more political posturing.

Best regards,

Fred Lange

Greg,
=20
Thanks again for  our discussion of last week.  As we discussed, TIBCO rema=
ins  very interested in collaborating with Enron on the commercialization o=
f the  Enron Online software.  We agree that a significant part of the chal=
lenge  with commercializing a software asset like Enron Online is to get it=
 ""out  of the starting blocks;"" that is, to get the first few customer sale=
s that  set a full-scale market opportunity in motion. =20
=20
We  would like to work with Enron to overcome the ""starting blocks""  challe=
nge by acting as the sales and marketing agent for the software.   Enron wo=
uld retain all IP, but grant the right to resell the software to  TIBCO.  A=
s a reseller, TIBCO would share in the revenue from the sale of  the softwa=
re.  For reselling, we would typically receive up to 45% of the  sale, depe=
nding upon the precise nature of TIBCO's responsibilites for the  marketing=
 and selling activities.  Similar to our discussions to date,  Enron involv=
ement in the sales process would remain critical.  The  involvement of an S=
I like Accenture would also continue to be important, but  TIBCO would act =
as the primary sales agent and apply its marketing capabilities  and sales =
force to selling the Enron software.  Again, we would be passing  the Enron=
 software through our sales channels without owning any of the  IP.  Based =
on 6 months to 1 year of activity we could then revisit whether  or not Enr=
on is interested in selling the IP to TIBCO.
=20
In  addition, though, we also believe there is a bigger opportunity for TIB=
CO and  Enron to collaborate that would yield greater benefitsfor both part=
ies.  That is, Enron could take an equity stake in TIBCO as  part of a larg=
er agreement for TIBCO to generally act as the partner for  commercializati=
on of Enron software assets.  We assume  that Enron has multiple software a=
ssets it would consider commercializing and a  broader agreement with TIBCO=
 would enable Enron to establish a process for  software commercialization =
that could be repeated for multiple assets.  The  nature of the agreement b=
etween Enron and TIBCO would be broader than just  resale, in that TIBCO wo=
uld assume the responsibility for all aspects of turning  the asset into a =
packaged software product and developing the related marketing  programs, i=
n addition to selling the products.  Enron would still retain  the IP to th=
e software assets, however.  Also, as a TIBCO investor, Enron  would see va=
lue not only in the revenue from software sold but also in the  appreciatio=
n of TIBCO stock, and all this value would accrue without Enron  giving up =
any IP. =20
=20
Obviously, this approach yields value over time from a software asset  rath=
er than up front, but it offers five key benefits.  First, it  provides a r=
epeatable process for commercialization of Enron software  assets--not just=
 Enron Online; second, it overcomes the ""starting  blocks"" problem while al=
lowing Enron to retain its IP and still take  advantage of TIBCO's software=
 commercialization processes and expertise; third,  it allows Enron to rece=
ive revenue from both software sales and TIBCO stock  appreciation; and, fi=
fth, it creates a larger software commercialization  framework that should =
have value in and of itself.
=20
We  hope that we can find a way to work with Enron on its software commerci=
alization  efforts, and we'd like to continue to explore the ideas here, in=
 addition to any  variations you may see as alternatives.

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

(1)  What is the Exercise Period (Commencement/Expiration Dates) for the

(2)  Is the Commencement Date also the Premium Payment Date?

(3)  For early termination purposes, is there just a single Optional Early

Would it be possible for you to forward the Early Term. Language that you 
requested be changed by Chase?  They have not responded at all and I would 
like to continue insisting by faxing it over to them as many times as it 
takes to get this issue reolved.  Let me know if this is possible.

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the ""NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS"" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as ""Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie"". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess
parachute payment,"" according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

I was wondering whether in addition to your talk on market and credit risk
at EPRM you would be interested in participating in the panel debate at the
beginning of day two? The panel will be a senior-level debate on the future
of the US power markets and I thought this might be something you would be

Hi Suzanne,
 
Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the actions
required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
documents which need to be executed are :-
 
1.  Novation Agreement

*	You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance in
NY soon
*	This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*	To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex 

*	Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom and
return via fax
*	As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need to
novate the collateral as well.

3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp

*	To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS

4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement

*	See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement letter.
*	This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names have to
be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
distributed to your payments division.
*	Please sign and return by fax

Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter. 
 
One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all documents to
be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a realistic
date for return.  Apologies for the rush.

Great job at actually getting something (almost) in writing from HL&P!

The big poles are just not suitable for neighborhood use, simply too big.  I
am, therefore, selfishly relieved that they are not continuing along my
street.  With all the townhome development, plus these mega-poles, what else
can be done to destroy the traditional appearance of our area?  Maybe
they'll put an environmentally sensitive second deck 20' above Montrose to
bypass the ailing downtown highways?

The attached explanation does however beg the question why there's one of
the new pole holes been dug on the NE corner of Peden and Montrose, when the
line runs down the west side of Montrose Blvd. and then west on Peden.

Subject: *EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P


Neartown neighbors,

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

Thanks

I refer to the List of Samples I crculated by fax yesterday (copy attached 
for your easy reference).

The Batangas samples referred to in Ref. Page 3 have arrived at SGS 
Singapore. SGS Philippines has explained to Eric why some containers are not 
full :-

The individual tank samples were drawn ex Pacific Virgo and put into 
containers but were not sealed. They were transported to the Subic Bay lab 
where ship's composite samples were made for testing by mixing the samples. 
The remainder was put into containers and sealed. One ship's composite sample 
was tested. Parts of some other sealed samples were used (ie. seals broken) 
for verification tests. The remainder were re-sealed, hence some containers 
are not full.

Please advise whether you wish for us at this juncture to enquire with SGS 
Philippines about the results/raw data of the verification tests.

I don't disagree with your comment however, my recollection is that one of the main reasons we made the decision we did was because the commercial folks didn't want to have to reopen the agreement with a rate amendment.  The concern I though was that such an overture would possibly send the wrong message to the customer or possibly create a perception that the customer had some leverage.  My question is, not that we need to amend the agreement for other reasons should we add the discounted rate... do it all at once?  Please provide your thoughts.  Thanks.  Greg

At a meeting held 2-3 weeks ago, it was decided that the P&C Agreements modified the terms of the base contracts and that separate rate amendments were not required.  I believe this was the consensus of the attendees in both Omaha and Houston.  Steve, Greg and others attended via videoconference in Omaha.

<6303726.1075856219633.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Re: Synfuel option valuation,"Lenny,

I believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit 
issue.  However, it may
make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed 
in the future. 

I am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit, which is built into 
the strike price for the
digital option. With the tax credit,  it is most likely the option will be 
exercised.

Paulo  Issler is the person who worked on this model initially. He will be 
back this Wednesday.
We can talk to him about the standard deviation he put into the model.

Subject: Re: Synfuel option valuation  

Zimin, 

Thanks for your e-mail.  Sorry for the late reply, I was travelling last week.
I'm under the impression that the with the new administration, there is a 
greater chance that Section 29 will be extended beyond 2007 than repealed. If 
this happens, we contractually have the right to extend this contract. We 
have not valued the chance of this happening, so I don't think we should 
value the chance of this not happening.

Anyways, let me speak to my supervisor on this and revert.

In the meantime, I looked over the amendment you made with regard to adding 
the second strike of the tax credit and think this is now reflective of the 
deal and am happy with it. I still do not understand a few things re:  where 
did the St. deviations come from. I believe you said that someone who works 
for you put this together but was away last week.

Please revert with his/her name so that I can get together and understand 
this.

Thanks.

Subject: Synfuel option valuation



Lenny,

I think we had a good discussion about the deal valuation. 
One thing, I think you are prefectly aware of it, is that the economics
of this deal is driven by the tax credit ($25.03).  The risk on our side
is that if the tax credit is removed, AIG will not deliver the synfuel 
 and pay $4.55 to us.  

Vince mentioned that Congress might act  quickly enough to eliminate 
the tax benefit.   I just want to remind you we should take this risk 
into consideration.

In its Order on Rehearing issued by FERC in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission directed the NYISO to re-calculate
operating reserve charges for March 2000 within 15 days.

The  NYISO  initiated  the  rebilling of March 2000 settlements through the
settlement  adjustment  process  on  the  afternoon  of  November 21, 2001.
Advisory  billing  statements  have  been posting to customer web locations
since  midnight November 22, 2001.  The NYISO anticipates completion of the
March 2000 settlement adjustment at approximately 18:00, November 23, 2001.
Posting  of  advisory billing statements will continue through the evening,
but should complete by 23:00.  Invoices are scheduled to be posted for this
settlement adjustment on, or about, December 7, 2001.

In  its  Order  on  Rehearing  issued  by  FERC  in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to  continue  to  bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect  for  the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will
reflect  this  re-calculation in accordance with the FERC Order.  The total
amount  of  this  adjustment  is  approximately  $27 million, which will be
allocated  to the appropriate suppliers and LSE's for the period of March 1
through March 27, 2000.

<28194741.1075840417031.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,RE: Shut - In costs,"Grigs,

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

Subject:	Shut - In costs

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  

Let me know your thoughts.

<22894940.1075840778055.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Re: Generation Earnings Model,"Michelle,
I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not
realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and
run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results.
This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like
we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but 
does not solve the problem. 

In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is optimal.
I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C,
but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Best,
Alex

Subject:	Generation Earnings Model

Hi Alex-

Danielle and I were talking to David M. today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results. Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations. 

We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process?

Thanks,
Michelle

  If there are 3 strips in a deal that cover different time periods, say April 1 for a strip, April 2 for another strip, and April 3 - 31 for a third strip....if we plug in a price on only one of the strips, are the days from the other strips going to get valued properly?  

 In the instances that we have had, all three strips were filled in and Risk valued the deal properly; it was just CARP and UNIFY that were reading three times the MW Month amount, which I guess in the end is a simple problem.

 Holden brought up this point and I wonder the same...do you know?

David,

We have talked to our development team and we have concluded that we will not 
be able to have the auction site up and running before August 14th. As we 
have discussed previously, it usually takes around 3 to 4 weeks to develop an 
auction site. However, due to the various projects that our developers are 
working on this timeline has been extended.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too 
long to address the immediate issue.

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let 
the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment 
would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it 
would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.

Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm 
just wondering what is public info.

Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his 
vote.

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies

that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee,

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this

I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's. I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect. We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids. However, in this case, the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me, and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed. I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end.

>",424,"Keoni,
I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's. I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect. We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids. However, in this case, the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me, and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed. I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end.

Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Thanks,

Mr. Tycholiz:

I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to
the above-referenced subject.  It is my understanding that the account
number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral
(""Agreement"") is incorrect.  I propose that the parties correct the error
by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.
Please review and call me at your earliest opportunity so tht we may
discuss further.  Thank you.

Therefore, there is no punitive tax expense created in the 3rd quarter by executing the 140 transaction.  The book tax calculations will be just the effective tax rate (approximately 37%) multiplied by the pre-tax book gain.

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler is

provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred

Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour ride

Just a follow up to our call this morning.  If you get your guy on the phone, 
try and get the following information:

1) Route map, including both end points of the network
2) Amount of capacity they may want to lay off, (they are currently using 
some of the system, how much do they want to offer?)
3) Any contract details, (how long, terms, penalties, restrictive clauses 
like ""cannot resell"")

Once we get some details on the table lets get a call together with them and 
see if there is a deal here.  I will be out of the office from the 3rd

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.

Paul,

Welcome back.  The Wyoming Governor's office wants to meet in August re energy issues.  I have identified the appropriate Enron nat gas people.  I would recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that meeting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mark Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he has had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions and will likely call to discuss. 

Scott Josey runs our producer finance business which finances/invests in upstream producers and projects.  He has some clients that may be interested in expanding a Wyoming position.

Let me know how you would like to proceed.

We do have Rafael on our radar screen as a loan program participant.  

Ted and Traci have been visiting with him, and plan to talk to him when he comes to Houston in November.  FYI - he wants to return to Enron as a Manager, not an Associate.  Additional background - he was an Analyst for a year in London, was promoted to Associate and went back to Columbia for his MBA two years later.

I don't know the individual, but given 2 years as an Associate - he may be a Manager candidate.  His visits with the business units in November should prove it out.

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might

I went through the code and realized that the change to show months with 0 value is a little big change and cannot be done in hours.

Also it will slow down option grid a little more as I need to build rows with 0 values which are not in database.

Analyst: Koch Venture Adds Value To Entergy-FPL Merger
By Bryan Lee
  
08/10/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The trading venture between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and 
Koch Industries will get a big boost from the utility's planned merger with 
FPL Group (FPL), marrying trading floor expertise with a commanding array of 
power plant assets.

So says Diane Borska, director of the utilities and energy practice at 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Fuld Inc., a consulting firm specializing in 
""competitive intelligence."" 
In April, Entergy and Koch formed a joint venture to trade electricity and 
natural gas. 

The Koch joint venture is ""the real killer thing about this merger,"" Borska 
said in an interview, in which she elaborated on her observations in a ""white 
paper"" analyzing the Entergy-FPL transaction. 

Once completed, the merger will put the combined company at the vanguard of 
competitive energy companies seeking convergence between physical assets and 
trading floor and risk management expertise, Borska said. 

Many companies are strong in trading floor and risk management expertise, but 
lack physical assets they can leverage in competitive electricity markets, 
Borska observed. 

On the other hand, utilities are rich in physical assets, but lack trading 
floor expertise, she said. 

In the past, ""the people who have excelled have not necessarily had physical 
assets,"" Borska said. 

But in the future, ""the people who are going to dominate are going to have 
both huge national asset portfolios and top-tier trading and risk management 
expertise,"" she said. ""It's not going to one or the other."" 

Koch has been in the top 20 in terms of trading energy. But adding the 
tremendous portfolio of power plant assets involved in the Entergy-FPL merger 
will undoubtedly bump Koch's trading into the top 10 or top five, Borska 
predicted. 

The stock transaction valued at $7 billion will bring together 48,000 
megawatts of power generation capacity, creating the nation's largest 
electric utility company with 6.3 million customers. 

Included in that staggering generation portfolio are 10,000 megawatts of 
so-called ""merchant"" power plants, which solely sell wholesale energy into 
competitive bulk-power markets, rather than serve a retail customer base. 

These competitive-market merchant plants are geographically dispersed in a 
complementary way, distributed among five regional power market hubs in the 
Northeast and mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Gulf South and Western 
states, Borska noted. 

The two companies' existing development pipeline would triple the existing 
10,000 megawatts merchant generating capacity, and plans call for growing the 
business into a 70,000-megawatt merchant-plant portfolio, Borska noted. 

""Additions to the fleet will come from additional nuclear power plant 
acquisitions and from green-field development of gas-fired plants,"" Borska 
noted in her white paper analysis of the transaction. 

The companies will be able to piggy-back onto Koch's 10,000-mile network of 
pipelines to supply their planned gas-fired power plant additions, Borska 
noted. 

The merger, when combined with the access to gas supply and trading-floor 
expertise of Koch, should cause investors to re-examine the higher valuations 
given pure-play generation companies compared to generation-rich combination 
companies, Borska said. 

AES Corp. (AES) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) have huge market valuations, but 
aren't known for engaging in ""large, deep trading,"" she said. 

""Their ability to fully leverage their assets in the marketplace has been 
limited,"" Borska said. 

The Entergy merger with FPL, when considered in light of the Koch joint 
venture, ""raises the bar for a Calpine or an AES"" to gain the capability to 
leverage their significant physical assets, Borska said. 

Other energy companies, such as Dynegy (DYN) and Duke Energy (DUK), marry 
significant generation assets with trading floor sophistication, Borska 
conceded. 

But they aren't on the same scale or geographic scope as the Entergy-FPL-Koch 
combination, she said.

MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Regards

> After performing an initial review of the revised availability numbers, 
which included performing spot checks on specific turbines, I have decided to 
discontinue any additional efforts on my part to validate the revised 
numbers.  The basis for my decision includes but is not limited to the 
following:
>
> 1)   The summary letter which accompanied the revised availability tables 
states:
>
>  ""To differentiate for times when the turbine is transitioning between 
states as per design, calculations have determined that during each month a 
turbine will have  between one and two hours meeting the above conditions.  
For this reason, the times determined using the conditions above (i.e. ""zero 
power availability"") were  decreased by 1.5 hours to account for the as 
designed transitioning times.""
>
>     I reject applying this rule.  A turbine is available to run or it is 
not available to run.  If a turbine remains down on repair for seven 
consecutive days its availability for  that seven day period is zero.  No 
credit should be applied for as designed transitioning times - at least this 
is how I interpret the contract.
>
> 2) On May 23, 2002 you received an email from me regarding the April 
Monthly Reports.  My email to you made specific reference to MR WTG#9 and its 
improperly  reported  availability.  On June 13, 2002, Mark Fisher, Joe 
Thorpe and I spent the entire day reviewing the availability calculation 
procedures, methodology, and  reporting.  MR WTG#9 happened to be a specific 
turbine in which we worked through the entire availability calculation.  Both 
Mark Fisher and Joe Thorpe agreed that  the reported availability was 
incorrect by approximately 5 percentage points.  Why was MR WTG#9 not revised 
for the month of April?
>
> 3) Your summary letter mentions low data recovery of 10-minute data for the 
December 01 time period.  Based on my understanding from Mark Fisher, the Mon 
files
>  form the basis for your availability reporting.  My availability analysis 
which primarily included investigation of the 10-minute data was frowned upon 
by Hollis  Kimbrough and he mentioned several problems with my method. He 
stated that the Mon files have a much higher data recovery rate. Did the 
10-minute data form  the basis for your revised availability tables?
>
> 4) In addition to MR WTG#9 as mentioned above, I have internal 
documentation that suggests that the revised availability percentage on MR 
WTG#2 for the month of  February remains on the order of 3 to 4 percentage 
points high.
>
> I recommend performing a more thorough review of the available information 
including SCADA files, maintenance records, and repair logs and then 
revisiting the recently reported numbers.  Please recall that I am requesting 
actual turbine availabilities uncorrected for maintenance allowances.  The 
revised numbers make no distinction.  I am also in need of complete monthly 
reports for both PA projects for the month of May which should have been 
received by June 20th.

Sorry for the delay in responding.

As for initiatives.  I have a VERY tentative product roadmap that plots the
Perfect course for the next 12-18 months.  Here's what I've come up with so
far.

Keep in mind that anything past V2.0 is a pure WAG.  Also, if you have any
questions about any of the specific features, just let me know and I'll try
to explain.

Also keep in mind that the name so companies mentioned for the integration
pieces is only tentative.  These are companies we are working with but have
NOT finalized any formal agreements as yet.

2) what the 3-5 major products/initiatvies are that you'd like to make
happen a little further down the road (e.g., 6-12 months from now)?
3) a description of those products/initiatives
4) the plan to execute on those products/initiatives?

Thanks alot.  And have a great weekend.

 - ProdRoadmap.doc",226,"Jeff,

Sorry for the delay in responding.

As for initiatives.  I have a VERY tentative product roadmap that plots the
Perfect course for the next 12-18 months.  Here's what I've come up with so
far.

Keep in mind that anything past V2.0 is a pure WAG.  Also, if you have any
questions about any of the specific features, just let me know and I'll try
to explain.

Also keep in mind that the name so companies mentioned for the integration
pieces is only tentative.  These are companies we are working with but have
NOT finalized any formal agreements as yet.

Regards,

Mike D.",103
<4123070.1075846661769.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,RE: Retail Testimony,"Eric,

I would like the following sentences added under the  I. Pilot Meter and
Meter Add-on Ownership Program.

""Customer ownership of meters and add-ons reduces the cost of new facilities
through the avoidance of the tax gross-up on contributions in aid of
construction.  This can be a significant dollar amount for large
interconnections which require special facilities which are paid by the
requesting customer.""

Please insert this between the 2nd and 3rd full sentences of the first
paragraph.  With this change, I do not think any additional testimony needs
to be filed on the meter issues.  This is the same approach in the PG&E
settlement and is not a Norm or Turn or Longbeach issue.  Any opposition can
be addressed in rebuttal.

Thanks

Craig

Susan,

Thank you for the revised drafts. My comments are as follows:

(1) Please date the Master Agreement as of February 1, 2000.

(2) Part 1(a) -Specified Entities. As Enron Corp guarantees the performance of
Enron NAC's obligations under the Agreement, please add the words ""Enron Corp,
but only to the extent that Enron Corp is a Credit Support Provider"". This 
seems
reasonable.

(3) Please re-number the pages so that the Schedule starts on page 19 and the
Paragraph 13 starts on page 11.

(4) Part 1(e) - Payments on Early Termination. I am checking with Tudor as to
whether they are agreeable to Loss for trades going out beyond two years. I
would say, however, that I am not aware that they have agreed to this with any
other counterparty. That said, Per's point that the trades are much shorter 
than
this is noted.

(5) Part 2(b) - Payee tax reps. Ospraie never makes payee tax reps other than
relating to its place of incorporation.  If this is an important point for 
you,
I will get out tax group involved.  However, Tudor prefers that neither party
makes payee tax reps.

(6) Part 3(b) - Documents to be Delivered.  Party B annual financials - should
read ""... 120 days after the end of its fiscal year"".

(7) Part 3(b) - legal opinion. Please confirm that you will pay the costs of
Cayman counsel.

(8) Part 4(h) - Jurisdiction.  I am checking with Tudor as ""any court"" is much
broader than the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY courts.

(9) Part 5(b)(g) - Commercial User rep. Tudor cannot make this rep. Please
replace with the following: ""Party A represents, with respect to Options, that
it is a producer, processor, commercial user of, or merchant handling, the
commodity subject to the Transaction or the products or byproducts thereof, 
and
is entering into each Option Transaction solely for purposes related to its
business as such"".

(10) Part 5(f) - Procedures for Entering into Transactions. Please remove the
word ""deemed"" in the last line. This is no longer relevant.

(11) Part 5(i). I am checking with Tudor. Is the ""no consequential damages""
consistent with Part 7 which expressly provides for the payment of out of 
pocket
expenses, the costs of a delta hedge etc. on non-payment of premium in a
currency option?

(12) Part 5(k) - Transfer.  For the part of the paragraph relating to Party A,
please change the proviso to read ""and provided that such transfer will not 
give
rise to adverse tax consequences to Party B or to a Termination Event or an
Event of Default, and the proposed transfer would not adversely affect Party 
B's
existing netting or set-off rights or under applicable law"".  The part of the
paragraph relating to Party B should provide: ""Party B may transfer its rights
and obligations under this Agreement with the prior written consent of Party 
A,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.""  These amendments are intended 
to
be reasonable and fair to both sides.

(13) Part 6 - line 2 ""Definitions"" - typo.

(14) Part 7(b) - please remove the reference to ""ISDA"". The FX Definitions are
previously defined in Part 5(e).

(15) Para 13(b)(ii). Please include longer term Treasuries. My understanding 
is
that this is what has been agreed, but please let me know if this is not your
understanding and I will check with Tudor.

(16) Para 13 (b)(iii). Please remove the reference to L/Cs.

(17) Para 13(d) - Specified Condition (Tax Event) should refer to Section
6(b)(ii) and Specified Condition (TEUM) should refer to Section 6(b)(iii).

(18) Para 13(g). I will check with Tudor.

(19) Para 13(g). I think references to ""Downgraded Party"" and ""Credit Rating
Event"" are inappropriate. Please clarify. Is there any way you will agree to 
the
provisions of Paragraph 6(c) without more? What seems to be important is that
the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party - i.e. Para 13(g)(i)(1) (not (2)).
This is consistent with Para 6(c) of the pre-printed form. Para 13(h) is 
related
to this issue.

(20) Para 13(i) and (j) - please remove. L/C-related provisions are no longer
relevant.

I look forward to receving revised drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph 13 and
guarantee in due course.

Kind regards.

Hello, Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty called this company and he was 
told that they should be set up in our system as Sierra Pacific Industries, 
Inc.  The contract has the long name on it so I am planning on asking Rhonda 
Denton about this tomorrow when she comes in.  I am not sure if it will work 
this way or not.  If you know anything else about this let me know.  Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc. is in Enpower but I am not certain if we should use 
that name.

I will let you know what Rhonda says tomorrow.

Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Joe, this is outstanding.  How can we help you get our 24/7 crude product on EOL in Japanese?  I'd like to get this done this quarter.  Also, forgive my inability to add and subtract, but how much did you guys book on this transaction?

Mike/Jeff,
 
As indicated in the list of deals and interested cps that we sent you yesterday, we closed a transaction with Japanese trading company, Kobayashi Yoko, this afternoon.  Kinoshita and Anai had been working this company and had already gotten basic documentation and credit approval in place.  We had also gotten prior approval from Sheila Glover and Gary Hickerson to use the local metal's trader to handle FX swaps up to USD30MM.  Commodity and FX risk (except for 4 days from contract settlement) have been hedged with Singapore and ENA.  Not a big deal in and of itself (notional USD250k), but a start.  We believe there is much more demand and plan to see more in the near future.  Also expect to see first LPG deal with Marubeni with our new mid mkt ""trader"" very shortly.  We would back to back transaction as well.  Details of this transaction are as follows:
 
Enron Japan sells Dubai swap to Enron Singapore

Month: March 2002

Volume: 12,500bbls

Price: 20.24$/bbl

Enron Japan sells US$253,000 to ENA

Value date: 5 April 2002

Price: 118.92Y/$

Enron Japan buys Dubai swap from Kobayashi Yoko

Month: March 2002

Volume: 12,500bbls (=1,987.34 kl)

Price: 15,110Y/kl",443,"For EJ, $500 minus the champagne for the two guys who did it.  Don't know what Slovenski booked against his curve.

<2047323.1075856236249.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Re: Fw: PSERC nuggets related to market Stem,"Hi Vince and Happy New Year
Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to
balance my commitments here.

Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members
while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition. We are
definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the
members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual
members could see way to convert to proprietary tools. The work that Shijie
Deng and Rajnish Kamat have been doing with me are good examples.

As to my trip, thanks for the invitation but I already committed myself to
get back Friday night so I will save my visit for another time.

I will tell my son about the spring interviews at Cornell. Hopefully this
time he will not miss it.

Regards, Shmuel

Subject:=09DSM projects as real options  =20

Vince:

Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power Po=
int presentation?  At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the following:=
  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES customers who =
employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR hurdles may be lo=
wered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow for the extra =
value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced power consum=
ption/dependence.

I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewi=
ng a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive. =
 First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we exer=
cise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple N=
PV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate ""negawatts,"" ext=
ending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of =
which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options=
 are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--wheneve=
r the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity pric=
e, associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value o=
f this strip a ""residual time value"" associated with the original DSM optio=
n.  If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total va=
lue that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able =
to help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high =
IRR hurdle.

Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a =
""qualitative"" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers t=
o lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The=
 attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.

We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least=
 one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage aroun=
d his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside =
a large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a sma=
ll portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology,=
 which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.

In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification=
, or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in th=
e attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify ""resid=
ual time value"" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of=
 a more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?

Thanks,

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the de=

need to finalize during this upcoming call.   I believe you should have 
received these via prior e-mail from Mary Moreland of your firm, but for your

I have since met with Ben on this agreement but wanted to let you see my 
comments as you are incorporating Deerfield's changes.  I was in meetings all 
day and just realized that I never sent this out.

Finance comments.  I have left a message with Rose asking what her comments 
to you were so we could coordinate.  Since I haven't heard from her yet I 
will provide these and follow-up if there are any others which need 
mentioning after I speak with her.

1.  The Effective Date needs to change to ""2001""

2.  In Section 2 Landscaping: To avoid any accounting issues raised by 
Accounting, it would be very helpful and along the intent as you indicated to 
Billy, if you would add at the beginning: ""After commencement of construction 
of the Facility but prior to the issuance of a CofO.......""

3.  Section 4 needs to have a global search done to change all the ""PBEC""s to 
""DBEC""s.

4.  Section 6:  Is the Facility truly deemed a ""Factory"" for permitting fees 
or are we changing the normal classification for a power plant in this 
agreement?

5.  Section 7(b):  Will we be charging the City for the easement for their 
cellular tower?  What is the consideration otherwise for doing so since we 
are paying them all sorts of money for the other items for which we are using 
the City?

 Extra period at the end of this Section.

6.  In the Termination Section can we put in the language from Pompano Beach 
which said that if the Agreement is terminated, all parties relieved of their 
obligations and an instrument would be recorded with County (offset to 
initial recordation of Agreement) indicating that Ag terminated and all 
obligations of the parties have been released?

7.  Does the City need to obtain any approvals prior to execution or at any 
other time to execute and have this be a valid agreement on their part?

8.  I noted that there is no Notices section nor Counterparts section.  Are 
they truly not needed here?  Execution occurring in same place on same doc?

Billy, 

It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, 
the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since 
construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 
E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it 
could be immediately prior to that time.  

Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed 
this agreement before she left.

the short drive to participate in the reception on the evening of the 4th. If

The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity

from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the 
transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers 
much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly

Mark,

I found an article in Risk, April 1999 titled ""Banking on energy derivatives: 
Brokers are acting more and more like investment banks, designing structured 
trades and bundled risk management solutions.  Nowhere is the trend more 
clear than in the energy markets.""   Also,  the attached reports describe the 
OTC market.  Please let me know where to go from here.

I am sending this document out to ensure that everyone knows what is required to process EPMI's Hanson Cement deal.  It is possible after reviewing all of the handoffs, that EPMI and EWS (Retail Generation) will wish to handle this deal in a different method.  

We need to come to some decisions very quickly.  There is a tremendous amount of coordination which needs to occur in order to service Hanson Cement.

Everyone please review responsibilities and let me know your comments.   

 

I will be working out of the Houston office this week.  The best way to contact me is via Cell @ 503-702-9846.

Tim Belden forwarded to me the files shown below for ""soft targets for Q1.""  It appears these reports are to track Middle Market transactions company wide.  However, the data does not match our records.  Attached is a recent report indicating Portland Middle Market year to date earnings of about $27 million and 163 transactions.  We also have the Services Desk here in Portland run by Greg Wolfe that is up an additional $3 million or so year to date.

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use=
 252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.=20

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calenda=
r Days (=3D Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the E=
IMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Zimin,

I have a question about historical volatility.  The way I have been calcula=

 returns of the price settles.  I then take that number (daily volatility) =
and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to come up wi=
th an annualized volatility.  The number of trading days that I have been u=
sing is 252, however I do not know if this is correct.  What I am trying to=
 do is calculate a historical volatility that would be comparable to the im=
plied volatility that we are calculating our books with.  The implied volat=
ilities are iterated using the euro function.  I get a straddle quote and I=
 iterate what volatility would be used to come up with that price ( I also =
look at the eimvol function).  I know that we use a 365.25 trading day conv=
ention in pricing our options, does this mean that to come up with a compar=

 historical volatility to an annualized volatility?

the questions are highlighted as well. Please look over it carefully and if 
there is language you are going to provide please do it post haste.

So, if there is a question, problem, disagreement, etc on language please 
work it out amongst yourselves and send me new language if applicable. 
Remember this is due to Rick BY 5:00 PM TODAY!!!!!

Well, we decided to keep the truck for about 5 more months.  The 2003
Expeditions should be coming out then.  We'll also be buying a new car in
June or July.  I would love to have a Lexus, but the price doesn't agree

body style similiar to a Lexus GS300.  I hate car shopping because of the
sly salesmen, but I'll do my homework beforehand.

Fine, I was thinking of you earlier today.  Just had a bite to eat and just
sitting here surfing the net.  Looking for some good vacation spots.   just
happened to be looking at Arizona for the heck of it.

How is you day going so far?  Already had lunch?  How did the car shopping
trip go on Saturday?

Hmm!  A vacation sounds great!!!  We're talking about going to Michigan
during the kids spring break. (March 11 - 15)  My aunt lives there.

Well, we decided to keep the truck for about 5 more months.  The 2003
Expeditions should be coming out then.  We'll also be buying a new car in
June or July.  I would love to have a Lexus, but the price doesn't agree
with my budget.  I'm now considering the 2002 Nissan Altima.  It has the
body style similiar to a Lexus GS300.  I hate car shopping because of the
sly salesmen, but I'll do my homework beforehand.

What's new with you?  How's your mom, sister and brothers doing?

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

I recently met Robert ""Bo"" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.",463,"Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.

Susan,

Before you spend too much making improvements (though the oven does need to be
fixed!)

Right now, it looks like Deron is not going to be moving in with me as he has
some concerns about the wiring for all of his computer gadgets.

I love my (your!) garage apartment and really do not want to give it up, 
however
I am not sure if it makes sense for us to keep paying 2 rents, so I am not 
100%
sure whether I will be renewing my lease after November.  If I did, it would
probably be for another six months (ie, I would delay moving in together, 
which
I am considering as there is no real reason to rush).

If I do not, I would be happy to post an ad for it here at Hewitt as I have
nothing but nice things to say about it and you!  Plus, one would be very
hard-pressed to find an irresponsible person here- there are lots of wonderful
people here.   I will try to make a decision by the end of Sept. as to give 
you
notice and enough time to try to help you find a nice tenant!

I am sorry to seem to fickle-  life is suddenly getting very complicated!

Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.  If you
have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty
old.  I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have
temperatures marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that
too!  The handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen
and bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood
around the A/C in the second bedroom.  If there's anything else you've

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,
Caroline

Subject:=09ME & NJ disclosure labels for direct mini forms -- PLEASE REVIEW


Heather --

Attached for your review are two new disclosure labels that we're working w=
ith Sarah Dietrich to prepare for the ME and NJ direct mini forms (same pro=
duct that we discussed several weeks ago for MA...direct marketing campaign=
 of fixed price, physical product).

The NJ label was adapted from Exhibit C of the NJBPU's posted Environmental=
 Standards http://www.bpu.state.nj.us/wwwroot/energy/envi.PDF using emissio=
ns and resource data from system power.  Please review and run it by your c=
ommercial team as well.

The ME label is adapted from the version you forwarded to me on Friday.  As=
 this is a fixed price product, similar changes were made to the language u=
nder ""Generation Price"" as were made in MA.  As this product does not have =
the excess and deficiency usage bands, EESI is not required to list languag=
e from the Maine Rules that explains price variability (as is the case in w=
ith the label you are currently using).  I've placed the product name in th=
e title of the label so that you will be able to differentiate it from the =
other product(s).  The only other changes I made were (i) removal of the tr=
iangles under ""Air Emissions"" that appear to be a carry-over from the MA la=
bel; the unit specific symbols are not required on the ME label; (ii) the f=
ootnote for ""Power Sources"" has been moved from the bottom of the page to d=
irectly under the power sources table; and (iii) removal of the bracket on =
the second page under ""Power Sources"".  Please review and let me know if yo=
u have any questions or comments about the changes I've made.  Also, please=
 confirm that the data reflected (for example, the 5.08 cents under avg pri=
ce per kWh) is current.

Thanks for your help.

Japan. FYI, on Wednesday I will have a confrence call with Brent Price to 
talk about EGM and Japan, from a Commercial Support perspective.

Subject: Re: Enron Japan Commercial Support Model  

Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office 
in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought 
processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations 
personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.  
While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good 
option.  

I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After 
several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a 
practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no 
meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your 
document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a 
note then if there are any other comments that I have.  

I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while 
you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some 
concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my 
schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the 
calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he 
is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person 
sometime in the not too distant future.  

Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business 
controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a 
location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential 
dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a 
long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join 
us.",436,"Sally

If you could provide me with a list of the individuals responsible  for billing each account, or even the customer acct. #'s themselves, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for your time and cooperation.

Sarah: I worked off of Dave's markup with which I concur, and included a few minor revisions. We don't talk about Governance issues. Is that not part of this docket? Also, in the reliability section, you may want to mention in  a footnote that the NYS Reliability Council is an example of a model we definitely do NOT want FERC to follow. As you know, that organization, which is separate from the NYISO, is made up of a select and specified group of market participants, and is dominated by the utilities.

Have a great holiday. Howard

Importance:     High 

Sarah, 

I have added a couple comments on the paper.  

I think it would be useful to use the specific information I have added about NY and their handling of the NYPA hydro projects in section II A.  I have added some cites from RT01-12 that hopefully provide what you are looking for as far a Commission statements about the number of RTOs.  There are some other miscellanous comments as well.

In the conclusion, I know our position has always been against penalties as it relates to things like ancillary services, but philosophically speaking I thought it may be beneficial to include some language which would allow the Commission some explict actions it could take if RTO compliance (started on time) was not met.  Otherwise I can just see them (the commission) drawing lines in the sand over and over again, like Dec 15, 2001 and the utilities just continuing being passive agressive.  Just a thought.

Kind Regards, 

Dave

Subject:        RTO Comments 

Attached are draft RTO comments.  The comments reflect EPMI's views on RTO development, given the Commission's apparent recent changes in position on the number of RTOs to be created.  We urge Right Sized RTOs without choosing a number.  


The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.

I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please ""Reply to All"" so everyone receives your comments.  

Thanks for everyone's help. 

Susan:  we should also have Kevin review the comments 

Alan:  Tim should probably review the comments as well, but check with Dave and Steve to see if the ""LMP in the West"" argument is correct before you show him the comments.

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of 
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having 
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence by 
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In 
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each 
turbine ID and status message.  

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status 
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be 
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in 
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

the scholarship interview team (Sally Beck, Andrea Reed, Roger Ondreko and 
Loftus Fitzwater).  I will be sending each of them a letter to thank them for 
their participation and encourage them to consider Enron when interviewing 
for full time opportunities next semester.

Thank you,

Karen Marshall",343,"All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great 
and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules 
next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want 
to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's 
letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting 
these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who 
the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes 
and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  Sally",114

Subject:	Houston American Heart Walk

Friends:

I have volunteered to be a Team Leader for this year's Houston American Heart Walk on Nov 3.  I sincerely appreciate your support.

The heart walk is a national event held in communities throughout America to raise funds for American Heart Association's fight against heart disease and stroke while increasing awareness of heart-healthy lifestyle.  In Houston, for every dollar raised, $2.50 is returned for heart disease and stroke research.

The venue is Sam Houston Park and walk will be along Allen Parkway, which will be closed to regular traffic.

There are three ways you can support by:
1.  Participating in the walk on Nov 3,
2.  Raising funds for American Heart Association from your family and friends,
3.  Making your own pledge and contribution.

Each walker is expected to obtain pledges from his/her circle of supporters.  Enron will match dollar for dollar and employees can submit match request online at www.easymatch.com/enron.  You will need your GIS ID ( the 900... number NOT your P#).  It is paperless.

I have pledge forms for you to use to sign up your family and friends.  It doesn't matter whether it's $5, $50, $100 or more, anything will be greatly appreciated.  Please respond to me so I can provide you with your pledge form.  Please note that the deadline to return all pledge forms with collected funds to me is 15 October.

Thanks in advance for your support and encouragement.  I look forward to walking with you on Nov 3.

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.
Few questions.

Mike,
   I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on
   behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active
   in any discussions on this bill?
   What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,
   their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the
   bill)?
   What about large customers?  They been screaming for more
   infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not
   delivering it.
   Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or
   opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the
   electric mayhem.
   There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the
   interstates from building into the state.
   If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when
   doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and
   noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,
   interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill
actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:  AB 23XX   Bad Bill Alert

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

Tell you what, just to make sure I can tell the difference between the lab 
and the Hen, I'll bring my own Lab!  Besides, when I hunted there last, we 
couldn't shoot hens.

PS-- I have my personal duck lease down here that we can also make 
available.  There are overnight quarters if we need them.  (Last year we took 
over 600 ducks off the properties).

 We just received the renewal notice for 2000/01.  I recommended to Dave N.

 I will ask Rosemary to give both of you notice when she gets the approval

1.  Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty.

ensure performance by the LLC.  Thus the language needs to clearly identify 
that this is a payment guaranty.  As long as Transco gets paid for the

2.  Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their

When you have some time, can we get together on the circumstances under which 
we should charge a business unit for the addition of a new Product Type?

I'm thinking specifically of the units which do receive a cost allocation, 
but are adding products which in our opinion are of questionable economic 
benefit.

These could be charged in accordance with our current price schedule. i.e. 
new Product Types added to existing businesses could be charged the 
incremental setup fees.  New Businesses would be the 250K.

If the Product Type is of clear benefit (e.g. Options for US Gas and for the 
guys we are training this week), then the costs would be part of next year's 
allocation.

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee

In response to your questions:

#1:  legal is fine.  done.
#2:  I'm fine w/that also.  Its basically saying the same thing as the ISDA.  
done.
#3:  I'm fine w/excluding the Joint Powers Agency (take or pay contracts) 
that cp may have.  done.  I don't recall them excluding it from the ISDA 
though...may want to verify and ask them of that.
#4:  I'm fine w/posting of 10days...as long as its on a bilateral basis.  I 
thought the ISDA accomplished that...but I may have misread it to apply to 
all margin calls similar to SMUD doing so.  Carol, can we have it apply to 
all margin calls?

Thanks for handling.

This is the latest skew calculator file.  It has a sheet for the vol skew table, and it calculates the ENA pdf using a linear interpolation between points on the table, not a polynomial.  

The file shows yesterday's settle data for Jun, and ENA data matches very well.  (All the 2001 contracts agree closely with ENA data from yesterday, in fact.)  I've added a macro that fetches the underlying price, volatility, and interest rate from our in-house EGSPROD32 database.  Let me know if this doesn't work for you.

Feel free to contact any of us if you have any questions or requests regarding this file.  hope it is helpful.

That fact that you asked ""who?"" begs the further question of what exactly you 
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?  
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has 
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the 
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of 
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated 
bilingualism).

To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the 
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were 
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the 
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at 
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.

Subject: Nice VP and possibly Pres.

When I look at Al Gore I continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 
million, Americans voted for him.  Both Clinton's and Gore's continued 
shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only 
slightly less amazing than the American people (or at least half of them) 
continuing to find reasons to support them.  My only, yet substantive, vested 
interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with US T.V. and I can't 
bear the thought of looking at Gore (and God forbid Hillary) for the next 
four years.  If they don't settle this Florida thing, I am going to have it 
have my cable disconnected.

We vote in our federal election on November 27th.  We will not have any such 
problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as ""parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by 
e-mail, confession of your sins on San Felipe.  For that matter, you are as 
bad as Clinton and Gore.)

Dave,

As I mentioned in my voicemail last night, I spoke with Randy and Aldo.  The 
tone was positive, and they said Goldman was very bullish on the whole 
story.  All these guys acknowledge that without our Trading stamp on NewCo, 
NewCo will not be a world class Genco.  With that said, it is apparent that 
Lew is telling these guys to go back and get more EXACT detail on what 
exactly Enron is willing to do in terms of people (both Trading and Risk 
Management). I would have to believe that a conversation between you and Lew 
would go a long way in making him comfortable that we are truly committed to 
NewCo, particularly with $400-$500 million of equity tied up in this entity.  
Apparently we have to arm Lew with everything that he needs to go to 
Broadhead to argue why NewCo makes sense and why they need Enron in this 
entity.  I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people, it 
is also philosophy, style and approach.  Given that we have said that we 
would nominate the Head Trader, I have tried to convey that we might be 
looking to utilize a lot of FPLE T&M people, but immerse them in our 
philosophy.  They are not comfortable with this, and have informed me that 
coming back with the answer that we will only put one Enron person in Trading 
is probably not the right answer.  Given the dynamic nature of Enron and 
Trading in general,  making a huge commitment of people I would imagine will 
be tough.

We talked through many other aspects including whether they think that they 
can do an IPO without us; the fact that having our involvement clearly 
increases the value of NewCo (raises an interesting question about how we get 
adequately compensated for this);  tight labor market in general and the fact 
that we don't have unlimited human resources here at Enron; and that in the 
early years, NewCo has very little merchant generation, and that all of it is 
FPLE 's (implies fewer people needed, and that we should be able to utilize 
FPLE Traders).  We also discussed the rumor about FPL's interest in Aquilla.

Sorry to bog down your vacation with this.  If you want to talk today, I will 
be around.

Thanks,

I thought I'd drop everyone a line to say hello.  I'm glad to hear that everyone is on celebrity watch.  I've seen none, let alone anyone with bang me against the headboard beauty.  I am a minor league baseball player though, does that count for anything?

Thanks for the great weekend.  I had a great time with you guys up at
the dome.

I just talked to my friend Curtis Press and he said to have you give him
a call about Annie and Vegas.  From what I know he is a very good vet.
He will also definitely let you know if the surgery makes sense (for
Annie) and who he thinks should do the surgery, etc.

He works most days at the Mission Valley Pet hospital in San Francisco.
The phone number there is 552-1969.  He and his wife also own a pet

Ken, please read

My prayers go out with you as grab the wheel of this ship and try to get it=
 back onto smoother waters However, I am currently enduring my own issues i=
n house. I am sending this note to point out that some basic values in our =
organization are lacking. I only want to point out to you my example of the=
 ambiguity of excellence. I attempted to attend the all employee meeting bu=
t was turned away at the door. The reason was I lost my badge during a busi=
ness trip last week. A Mr. Alex Varez (director security) informed me that =
no one can enter the meeting without an Enron ID badge. So I waited and wat=
ched. I watched as three gentleman were let in by a Mr. Steve Kane or Kean.=
 I questioned Mr. Varez and a Mr. Mark Jeffries as to what criterion did th=
e rules change. He stated Mr. Kane/Kean vouched for the gentlemen. Of cours=
e I left and hurried back to listen to your assessment and write this e-mai=
l. The fundamentals are often waived just like the entry of the three gentl=
emen who where allowed in the meeting. The sad part is that I have been her=
e almost five years and shook the hands of 5 people entering the meeting al=
l who could have vouched for me. However, in this example knowing the right=
 person mattered. The rules did not apply equally. I said all this to say n=
ow more than ever you need to drive home our values. And force a wholesome =
discipline throughout our organization. It appears that the management team=
 is looking at external indicators instead of internal indicators. If we fe=
el our values are being delivered in-house then the collective ""we"" will ch=
ange external perceptions.=20

Here is some food for thought that will assist in changing the direction of=
 Enron. I do not know if you are a God fearing man. However, my intuition s=
ays you are. The foundation of the EBN is on blessed ground, the earth is o=
ld church property. I don't know if you ever considered that but I am relat=
ively sure that it is fact. Any business within the walls on this ground is=
 in a better position to prosper. I am not sure if the new building is on t=
he blessed grounds. It could be beneficial to have the new building blessed=

uccess as we move forward.

Dear Andrew-

London Metals has been selected to be reviewed under the ""Doorstep"" process the week of Nov. 5.  The process involves a review of the current market issues as well as an operational review of the front/mid and back operations.  The doorstep team will consist of Brenda Herod, a member from RAC and an Andersen staff member.  I am helping facilitate the process.

In order to start this process, I need to get a few items from you:

A list of traders and Orginators who can help our team gain an understanding of the current Metals business
A list of mid/back office personnel whom that we could talk to help us understand the existing control structure and management reporting as well as anyone else who we might need to meet with that you feel would or could add value to the process
A population of deals and transactions over the last 10 -12 months that will allow us to start pulling our sample for deal testing
Any other material that you may have that would allow us to do some pre-reading prior to our visit in order to help our understanding of the Metals business.

We will be working closely with EAS/Andersen to ensure that we are not duplicating efforts.  

Please advise as to how would be the best way to schedule interviews - would you prefer that we contact the individuals that you identify for interview or should we coordinate that process through someone in London.

Thank you for your help.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at (713)853-1781.

Subject:	Revocation:  Signing Bonus

The initial view on this was that we should not pay signing bonuses when we revoke offers of employment, but I have continued to give thought to the issue and my concerns.  It appears that our offer letters refer to the bonus as a ""sign-on bonus"" and ""signing bonus"" and state that it will be paid within 30 days of hire.  The letter does not address what to do if we revoke, or if the applicant revokes.   

I think that based on the ""signing"" language, applicants could argue that because they signed, we owe signing bonuses.  

On the other hand, signing alone really can't be enough to justify payment; I don't think anyone would buy off on the idea that an applicant could sign, refuse to show up, and still be owed the bonus.  

Balancing those considerations, I think a viable argument can be made that an applicant who signs and professes a willingness to still show up must be paid the promised signing bonus.  As such, I think we have some exposure here.  I can't assess how much, in part because I don't have an estimate of the dollars at issue.  I do, however, understand that we plan to revoke approximately 100 offers, not necessarily all of which will involve signing bonuses. 

Any thoughts?

on weather derivatives. All these papers included in other RISK books were

I have no way of being able to discuss cost implications of changing the
post card language, since I do not know the current costs and have not
reviewed the ERCOT contract for the customer care center.  Prior to the
meeting, could someone at ERCOT forward that information including a break
out for the mailing cost and also invite a person from the subcontractor to
prepare estimates on the costs associated with the changes (such as going to
a larger card or envelope to assure that customers get all the necessary
information to make an informed decision)?

Also, could we begin at 2 instead of 1?   Three hours should be more than
adequate and the time conflicts with another PUC/Gov. office function.

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last
paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last
month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have
large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City
and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on
the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and
LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future
ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader
examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

3) Are the ""exemption conditions"" with which the facility must comply just the conditions listed in the document?
4) Could you clarify: Do the conditions described in the document apply to us now, or only if we become ""regulated""?


As per our conversation, I understand that FX is subject to even less stringent requirements than our current commodities are. 

Thanks,

Dave

Subject:	Electronic Trading Facilities for Transaction in Exempt Commodities

Attached is a brief outline of the requirements for electronic trading facilities for transactions in exempt commodities.  Exempt commodities are all commodities other than financial commodities (e.g. interest rates, currencies, securities) and agricultural commodities.

 << File: Electronic Trading Facility for Exempt Commodities.doc >>",280,"Using your numbers:
1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to.
2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.
3. Yes
4. Only if we become ""regulated.""  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules.",101

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14"" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

Ben,

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS


Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d",296,"Ben

... hey you, are you interested in going in on a gift for Jessica and Clay
from Dished from the Past?  We want to get them something nicer that costs a
little more... Emily and Lisa and I are going in together so far...

It was so good to see you last night although when we're in groups like that
I feel like I don't really get to hear SCOOP... did you end up going to
Woody's?

I heard on KPFT this mornig that Bruce Cockburn is coming to Aerial Theatre
May 11th and that would be an awesome concert too... we may have to go to
that one too!  He sings ""Last Night of the World"" and then this amazing song
that was on around 7:40 this morning that you may have heard... so good!  Oh
my goodness Susan, I forgot to tell you about this new cd I bought
Wednesday... The I-10 Chronicles... I heard about it on KPFT and it is
awesome!!! It's a compilation cd with Joe Ely, Adam Duritz, Willie Nelson
and more... you of all people would love it! :o)

Okay, now that I've filled you in on all I have for now... let me know what
you're up to this weekend...maybe we can veg together...

Happy Friday!

Hello all,  Lorraine and I have been unable to get ourselves down to 
the meetings lately.  Being new parents has us pretty exhausted but 
we are getting the hang of it.  Tyler James is growing so fast.  
Maybe next month we will make it.  

Anyway, we did have a question about the newly adopted city lot size 
ordinance that was passed in December.  Is there something printed 
that specifically addresses how this affects our neighborhood?  Do we 
know what the average lot size is in Montrose?  Does this mean that 
no more old classic homes can be torn down to build 3 townhomes?

Also, we were wondering if anyone has noticed the parking problems 
lately due to the Eclesiastic church on Taft?  They seem to provide 
no parking for their events which seem to occur more often every 
month.  They have done alot of work on that church and I have never 
noticed one single permit posted on their structure.  We don't really 
know these people and have nothing against them but don't they need 
to comply with city parking and building codes?

Maybe these issues can be addressed in next months newsletter?

Mary:
Looks like credit wants to begin putting in place Master Netting Agreements with some of our major counterparties.  In most cases, we will be dealing with multiple entities on both sides that are organized in the US, UK an Canada.  Assuming that all of these entities have entered into Master Agreements, how comfortable should we be in including all of the entities under one Master Netting Agreement?  Are there consideration, preference etc. issues that we need to be concerned about and has our outside counsel analyzed this for us?  Would we be better off grouping all of the US entities under one and doing the same for the Canadian and UK entities?

I would appreciate hearing from anyone that may have some thoughts about this as credit would like for these to be [put in place by the end of the 3rd quarter.  Thanks.

Power. Please let me know if you have a problem with this issue. In addition, if you could provide guidance on commercial hiring protocol, I would appreciate it. Hope this isn't an inconvenience.

<9360315.1075859528957.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Enjoyed meeting you,"Dear Elizabeth---Just wanted you to know I truly enjoyed meeting you today.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share
your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more of
a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of
Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble
deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and
settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative
processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of
working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available
opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,

I haven't had the opportunity to read the PD yet, but I share your
frustration with the Commission's inaction in the face of significant and
fast moving events.  Our settlement and electric restructuring are clearly
distinguishable.  Arguably, the status quo has, in part, perpetuated the
record high prices being observed of late.  The Commission should have
little to fear by proceeding with its initial direction of statewide
consistency in the intrastate gas industry.

If I'm reading pages 38 - 40 of the Bilas PD correctly, the Commission's
primary concern over the competitive benefits of city-gate pricing is the
fact that PG&E city-gate prices in October were much higher than border
prices plus transportation.  October bidweek PG&E city-gate prices were
high, but only because southern California prices plummeted from the high
levels that they had reached in late August and September, following the El
Paso explosion.  In November, the PG&E city-gate moved back into its normal
relationship with Topock and Malin prices.  For the Commission to be
spooked
by one month of price fluctuations is crazy.

I'm hopeful that my friends at Edison, in particular, can help the
Commission to distinguish what we were trying to achieve in the CS on the
gas side from the mess that is electric restructuring....

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability  (2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same  under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for consequentials (absent a waiver)?

We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates 
haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little 
questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the 
receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK

And thanks. too, to Leslie.  The EES piece of the California puzzle is

After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.

 - Intervention -- SLNG Vaporizer & Stabilzer.DOC",287,"Please see below the draft of our ""potential"" intervention into the current 
application process at FERC re. Elba Island.  

We have been working with Shelley Corman to assure that we won't be stepping 
on any toes.  Shelley feels our draft is fine aside from some minor language 
changes.  She also committed to run it by Stan Horton this morning and we 
will address any concerns he has if necessary.

We also plan to forward/discuss with the El Paso FERC people prior to 
submission.

Please call if you wish to discuss.

Also if you have received a similar note from me earlier this morning, I 
apologize.  I am sending this for the second time as I am concerned that my

Subject: Kern River deal



Wow ... this is huge! 

I've met with executives of Mid-American Energy in the context of doing my Fiber Links business and I didn't come away too terribly impressed.  It's undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant, David Sokol, both have a reputation for finding ways to make money, but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of Mid-American that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River.  Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world?  

Jeff 

p.s.  While at Mojave, Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas control/operations puke like the rest of us.  He's apparently done quite well at KRGT.


Williams to sell Kern River for nearly $1B 
Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed 
to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings 
for nearly $1 billion. 
MidAmerican, a unit of investor Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, will pay 
Williams $450 million in cash and assume $510 million of Williams' debt in order to 
acquire Kern River. The deal, part of Williams' ongoing effort to strengthen its balance 
sheet, is set to close by March 31 assuming regulatory approvals. Williams said selling 
the Kern River system will save the company about $1.26 billion in capital expenses 
over the next 18 months. 
MidAmerican, meanwhile, said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline, 
which currently has a capacity of 835,000 Mcf/day and extends 926 miles from Opal, 
Wyo., to California's San Joaquin Valley. Built in 1992, it is a key route for shipping Rocky 
Mountain gas to markets in the western United States, particularly Southern California. 
The expansion project, due to be completed in May 2003, will more than double 
the pipeline's capacity to 1.7 Bcf/day, according to a filing Williams submitted to 
FERC in August. The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed $2 billion, 
MidAmerican said in a release. 
""We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission, which 
we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America,"" said David 
Sokol, MidAmerican's chairman and CEO. Upon completion of the sale, Kern River will 
become a subsidiary of MidAmerican. Bob Sluder, senior vice president and general man-ager 
of Williams' Kern River and Northwest systems, will become president of the new 
MidAmerican subsidiary. 
As for Williams, ""We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to 
meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies, which now require com-panies 
like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investment-grade 
credit rating,"" President and CEO Steve Malcolm said. ""The sale of our Kern River sys-tem 
is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our busi-nesses 
now and in the future."" 
Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsa-based 
company delayed the release of its 2001 earnings to iron out debt issues related to 
the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary, which it spun off last year. Ear-lier 
this week, Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance $1.4 billion 
of WGC-related debt (GD 3/5). 
Williams' stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the 
heightened scrutiny of U.S. energy merchant companies in the wake of Enron's bankrupt-cy 
in December (GD 12/4). 
In releasing its earnings Thursday, Williams reported a 2001 net loss of $477.7 mil-lion, 
or 95?/share, compared with net earnings of $524.3 million or $1.17/share in 2000. 
The 2001 loss includes pre-tax charges of $2.05 billion relating to WGC. 
WGC said income from continuing operations for 2001 was $835.4 million, compared 
with $965.4 million a year earlier. The total WCG-related charges of $2.05 billion repre-sents 
80% of the total WCG-related guarantees and payment obligations, and the deferred 
payment for services provided to WCG, Williams said. 
Also Thursday, Williams said it will raise $275 million through the sale of 9.875% cumu-lative 
convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy 
Holdings. MEHC will acquire 1.46 million shares of the security at a price of $187.50/share,

to close by March 31 and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction.

Williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group.  They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.  Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).  The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.  Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.

I am included my modifications to your brief.

I have rearranged the topics somewhat because I think our most important 
point in to stress the importance of using market based prices -- and, 
failing the acceptance of our proposal -- to stress that on-peak pricing not 
be unduly or arbitrarily high.

My comments have been restricted to this section on market based pricing.  I 
have also tried to answer the questions you had in [ ...].

Please consider my comments to be from Scott and me since we are working

Subject: Brief on Rate Design


Attached is the initial draft of the brief on rate design. As of now it is
still due on Friday the 27th (although the ALJ indicated Friday afternoon
that there may be some slippage until Monday).

Keeping with a discussion that Leslie, Harry and I had on Friday, I have
kept the  brief short -- focusing solely on our proposal. As Leslie said in
her e-mail about Friday's hearing, there is alot of animosity towards Enron.
The ALJ is clearly no on our side.  Weighing in on issues where others are
carrying the ball (direct access, reallocation of 130% of baseline exemption
revenues) is unnecessary and may hurt instead of help our cause.

Any way, take a look at the brief, and we can perhaps have a call on
Wednesday to discuss.

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Hi Dan and Tom,

Greetings.  I hope all is well with both of you and PPG.

I recently received information that transmission voltage customers will
likely be required to be involved in the Electric Emergency Plan (EEP)
in the future.  Currently transmission customers are not ""required"" to
curtail any load when distribution circuits are taken off line as a
result of a Stage 3 EEP operation.

Please take a look at the attachment below and if possible provide
comments to help shape the proposed change.  I will need comments by
this Friday noon if possible.  Thanks for the input.

Enclosed is an article which mentions Enron and the '99 to 2000 change.


Oil industry has fingers crossed over Y2K bug
By Richard Valdmanis 
NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Despite some glowing reports on Y2K readiness in 
the U.S. oil and gas industry, private analysts, and even some of the more 
forthcoming oil companies, say there is no way to know whether the computer 
glitch will result in fuel shortages to consumers. 

""After all the research that's been done and all the data that's been 
collected, we don't really know what will happen when the clock strikes 12 on 
New Year's Eve,"" said Dr. Martin Weiss, Chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc., which 
has been tracking Y2K compliance among major U.S. companies for more than a 
year. 

The Y2K bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only 
recognize the final two digits in a year. The glitch could result in 
malfunctions if the computers mistake 2000 for 1900. 

For the energy industry, which depends on the electrical grid as well as 
internal computer systems, the Y2K bug could lead to unsafe operations at 
refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments - a daunting possibility for 
the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter. 

Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly 100 percent of the oil 
and gas industry will be ready for Y2K - a far more encouraging percentage 
than the roughly 50 percent reported a year ago - some companies say it would 
be foolish to expect no surprises. 

They point out that the Y2K situation is one for which there is no precedent 
and the task of finding all non-compliant computer chips in the 
interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth. 

Enron Corp. (ENE.N), a major U.S. petroleum company and pipeline operator, is 
among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring. 

Despite their best efforts to upgrade their ""mission critical"" systems -- 
those that are essential to their business -- the company says ""there is no 
assurance that (our Y2K) plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or 
that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan 
that would materially and adversely affect Enron."" 

Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 

The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on 
which the company depends are likely to find and replace all non-compliant 
computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a ""cascading 
effect"" of system failures. 

""The problem is not, and will not be, unique to Enron,"" the company added. 

Though Enron has not announced any precautionary Y2K shutdowns, a number of 
other major U.S. pipeline operators have. For example the Colonial Pipeline, 
the largest in the nation, plans an eight-hour shutdown starting on New 
Year's Eve. 

Explorer Pipeline, the second largest, plans a 20-hour shutdown before the 
rollover into the new year. 

The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and 
other fuels per day between Houston, New York and Chicago. 

In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions, as well as an expected 
buy up of fuel by nervous consumers, retail gasoline operators are planning 
to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal 30 day 
inventories, according to industry and government officials. 

The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential 
disruptions at U.S. refineries, which produce the gasoline. 

By most accounts, refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron 
out Y2K problems. According to Weiss Rating Co., the majority of large U.S. 
oil refining companies, like Exxon Corp (XON.N) and Mobil Corp. (MOB.N), are 
either average or above average in their adherance to Y2K plans mapped out 
more than a year ago, and only a handful, like Chevron Corp (CHV.N) and 
Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp (UDS.N), are rated below average. 

""While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry, 
refiners seem to be the more prepared,"" said Dr. Weiss. ""Over all, the energy 
sector appears to be taking the Y2K problem seriously - but that is no 
guarantee that the New Year will be a non-event."" 

According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute (API), the Natural 
Gas Association and other industry trade groups, nearly 100 percent of the 
nation's refiners, retailers, and pipeline operators will be ready for the 
year 2000 turnover, which comes in less than two months, by having Y2K proof 
systems in place and contingency plans if they break down. 

""What the reports are saying is, the trade groups are confident these 
companies are going to be Y2K ready, and that's encouraging,"" said an 
official at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). ""But obviously 
nobody can make any guarantees.""

I have provided the additional questionnaire which we sent to our European 
counsel with respect to trading in Bandwidth capacity. You may wish to 
provide this to your counsel as a basis for the questionnaire regarding the 
physical trading of Bandwidth capacity. Please note that one of the key 
issues may be the location of the respective geographical points for each 
Bandwidth transaction. We would anticipate that there would be fewer issues 
or none at all where a particular counterparty wishes to trade in Bandwidth 
capacity where the two respective geographical points are not located in 
their jurisdiction. (ie. A German counterparty trading Bandwidth from 
Brussels to Paris)

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will

Sally, I think will get out and do an Indian Rain dance, as the rain is
falling and we need lots ot that!  MY reason for writing however, is to say
that we will look forward to your having lunch with us at 12:15 on September
5th at the University of Texas Club.  Cindy said you would be in town and
that would be a fun celebration, and Cindy and family will join us.  I am
also going to invite my cousins, Fab and Mary Anne.  Cara will in New York at
that time.

The other is, I am thrilled that you and your family are going to be able to
go to Hallettsville for Dot's birthday and Cindy, Richard, and Brigeda will
be able to be there also as they were able to change their plans for the
beach to the following week-end, so I think it will be lots of  fun, and I
know it will mean a lot to Dot too.  In fact I called her today and told her
you all were going to be able to be there.  Cara will decide when she gets
home from CA I guess,  She will be home from New York on the 7th.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for

You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahe=

mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART off=

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand cor=
rectly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that i=
t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART t=
rade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a ""US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART""  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

""This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices.""

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Subject:=09Day Ahead ""Financial"" Parking/Lending product

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=

We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  

AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).

Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Regards
Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help

Stephanie -

Please advise the counterparty that we will be terminating the below agreements:

	Master Energy Price Swap Agreement b/t ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES and BELCO OIL & GAS CORP.
	Master Energy Price Swap Agreement b/t ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES and BELCO ENERGY CORP.


There are two reasons why we wish to terminate these agreements.  First, they do not contain threshold/margining provisions, except in the case of a default or material adverse change.  Second, the documents are the old master agreements and not ISDAs. 

If the counterparty still desires to trade under the name Belco Oil & Gas Corp., I am happy to provide them with an ISDA draft, but I want to review the latest financials of Westport Resources Corporation (the surviving entity) to assess credit quality and provisions required for the new master.  They will need to provide us with the new financial information.  In the meantime, I am content to allow trading under the ISDA with Westport Oil & Gas Company.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

Attached are a clean copy of suggested modification of the body of this DASH as well as a copy of the original DASH.  This should give you some sense of the Arcos project's scale and risks.  John Sherriff and Michael Brown reportedly remain confident that this can be sold at a profit in the next three to nine months; however, if it is not, our economics on this project with a current termination cost of over $200 million is a negative NPV of approximately ($150 million).  The Enron board has not seen this, largely because the turbine cost is not specifically related to this project, but no other use of the turbines has been identified, so this project represents a huge potential loss if the sale is not successful.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.

Pedro,

I have attached my mark-up of the body of the DASH (it is not possible to mark the entire DASH with the new template) for your review.  Many of the comments I have made were based upon input from Chip Schneider to try to promote comparability of this transaction with similar development projects undertaken in the U.S.  In general, the view from Houston is that this project represents a significant amount of capital at risk and that this fact, as well as the expected economics of the project, should be highlighted to a greater extent than in the draft of the DASH you prepared.  While not noted on the DASH, discussion of where the 9FA turbines may be redeployed if this transaction does not progress to completion should be discussed somewhere in the DASH.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

LLC.  By the way, I just received the interoffice envelope with the two 
originals, and I will have Eric Grest sign them both.  I will return one 
fully executed original to you ASAP (thank you very much!).

Would it be possible to receive the electronic version today, as I'm 
scheduling a conference call for the CGEY people, and they must each have a 
copy of the agreement prior to the call?

Thank you very much!

I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of 
Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14"" monitors 
per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.  Will 
try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, 
attractive look.    

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve 
Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs 
are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, 
non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have 
a 3 month implementation schedule.

Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) 
or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc.

Let me know next steps.  We can discuss funding sources.  - Bill",143,"Beth, Mark -

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.

needs to be able to invoice Calif power customers is the 810 EDI files from
all 3 CA utitlities.  They have stopped sending 810s to us and are only
providing 867's.   If we can't get the 810s going then the information
provided in the attached spreadsheets needs to get to us in order to
invoice.   This info could come via spreadsheet, or line item within the
867.   The business impact to Enron is that we have not been able to
invoice for these customers since Dec 5 and this is a large revenue amount.

Please call me - my cell phone is 713.305.1659 if you have questions.
After 11:30 central today, I will be on vacation and my backup Maggie Brown
can be reached 713.822.3753.

needs to be able to invoice Calif power customers is the 810 EDI files from
all 3 CA utitlities.  They have stopped sending 810s to us and are only
providing 867's.   If we can't get the 810s going then the information
provided in the attached spreadsheets needs to get to us in order to
invoice.   This info could come via spreadsheet, or line item within the
867.   The business impact to Enron is that we have not been able to
invoice for these customers since Dec 5 and this is a large revenue amount.

Please call me - my cell phone is 713.305.1659 if you have questions.
After 11:30 central today, I will be on vacation and my backup Maggie Brown

credit support for MG and PaperCo.

My approach is as follows:

1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.
2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.
3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the 
default option)  using Black's formula.
4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is 
treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back 
this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced 
rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two 
NPV's.

Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.
Few questions.

Mike,
   I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on
   behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active
   in any discussions on this bill?
   What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,
   their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the
   bill)?
   What about large customers?  They been screaming for more
   infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not
   delivering it.
   Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or
   opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the
   electric mayhem.
   There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the
   interstates from building into the state.
   If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when
   doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and
   noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,
   interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill
actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:  AB 23XX   Bad Bill Alert

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

Thanks for the comments.  Here are my responses:

1.  Introductory Paragraph - Section (a) is unacceptable as this places an 
administrative burden on Enron that currently does not exist.  Section (b) is 
acceptable.

2.  Paragraph 3 - Changes are acceptable.

3.  Paragraph 4 -  Changes in this section are acceptable, however, it is 
Enron's strong preference that no indemnity language be included.

4.  Paragraph 5 - Deletion of this provision is unacceptable.

5.  Paragraph 6 - This deletion is fine.

6.  Paragraph 7 - This change is acceptable.

This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Jeff Hodges has told me that you are helping us out with trying to locate information re: the Midwest Generation Labor Dispute.  The following article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today:

Under a settlement agreement signed with the National Labor Relations Board, Midwest Generation LLC, a wholesale power supplier to Commonwealth Edison Co., will begin negotiating as early as next week with the union representing 1,150 of its electrical workers, officials said. The move comes less than two weeks after the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local authorized a strike. The sides have disagreed over when the current contract expires; under a separate agreement, Midwest Generation was released from its obligation to maintain the existing contract through June 2002, company officials said.

Would there be any way to obtain details about this, or is it probably a confidential settlement?
Thanks for the advice.

Subject:	Requested pressure cut at Citizens Griffith TW Interconnect


Citizens had concerns about the amount of noise and vibration at our Citizens Plant Station and has recently had an expert on this subject visit the site and take measurements.  The preliminary report indicates that the current configuration could potentially fail at full load conditions with a inlet pressure exceeding 740 psig.  Since Citizens does not want to limit the capacity of the power-plant, we are asking that your delivery pressure be temporarily reduced to 700 psig.
I have attempted to document the different operation modes that we have observed your station operating under along with any back-ground information that I was able to document. As discussed, in the design phase of this interconnect, I was informed that batching would only occur under low flow conditions, and do not understand the benefit of batching in the manner that was done earlier this year.
Per our customers request (Griffith Energy) Citizens installed equipment capable of measuring down to extremely low flow rates that include three measurement runs.  A 10"" Instrument Ultrasonic, a 4"" Invensys Turbine meter, and a 2"" Instrumet Rotary meter.  Although I questioned this requirement at the time, the low flow condition occurs so rarely, it is inconsequential.
I have analyzed our log files for the month of November (11/1/01-12/6/01) and found that the only time the smaller runs operate is momentarily as the power plant starts up.  The following volumes are accumulated totals per run for this time period.
Run Size        TW      Flow (Mcf)     Percent of Flow                              EPNG    Flow (Mcf)        Percent of Flow 
2""                                   107.9              0.0089%                          0.2            0.0018% 
4""                      1,280.8              0.1059%                                                 2.1                  0.0153%
10""                         1,208,076.9            99.8852%                                          13,714.4                99.9829%
My point is that in the event that you do not feel comfortable in setting your actuated valve immediately downstream of your flow control valve to take Citizens' requested pressure cut, consider temporarily using the flow control valve as  pressure control.  The month of November included considerable power-plant testing, and therefore the above numbers are higher that during commercial operation.
When TW found it's in a difficult situation in regards to finding a solution to measuring a low flow (which appears to be erroneous information), Citizens worked with you in good faith.  All we are asking is the same in return.

Hi Jason,
First of all, just want to wish you Joanna a happy thanksgiving.  We certainly have a lot to be thankful for.  Susan and I are leaving tonight visit her dad.  I'm going up to Wisconsin to visit Mimi in two weeks.  She still sound very tired.
Hear a lot of stuff about Enron.  I hope you are still doing OK.  I'm sure you've created value for yourself and should be fine.  It is just amazing to see a company that size make the mistakes that it did. But, the bottom line is that it is run by humans.  And that is how we learn.
Are you going to the game on Friday?  It would be great to see A&M pull out a win.
Love,
Dad",253,"Happy Thanksgiving to you too.  Things at Enron don't look promising for anyone right now, but we'll see what happens.

Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term

PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in

Subject: Brief Summary of Today's Activities in California (at Least Thus 
Far)  

The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared 
yesterday.  Three key changes:
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the 
entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of 
gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will 
consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to 
lower chances of a successful utility appeal).
The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the 
pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will 
submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.
On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that 
legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the 
utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result 
of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, 
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the 
utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is 
currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're 
working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in 
California, to get more info and will report back.
The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer 
rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  
Only FERC was demonized more.

Subject: Dirk vanUlden

Jim--

I am in the EES Legal Dept here in California.  Jeff Dasovich of Public and 
Gov't Affairs asked me to send you an email soliciting your thoughts 
regarding Enron employees participating in third-party deregulation-related 
companies.

Specifically, an Enron employee here in California (Mr. Dirk van Ulden) has 
been asked to serve on the ""advisory board"" for a deregulated industry 
startup called UtilityGuide.  UtilityGuide's goal is to create an online 
forum for buyers and sellers of deregulated energy services.  UtilityGuide 
would be funded by (a) transaction fees paid by services providers, and (b) 
revenues derived from advertising and sponsorship.

The management of UtilityGuide includes an ex-White House policy analyst (I 
don't know which administration), a web design consultant and former 
marketing manager for Greenpeace, and an ex-portfolio manager for Union Bank 
of California.

Mr. van Ulden would be one of seven on the advisory board, which does not 
include any management activities.  Mr. van Ulden's main duties appear to be 
assisting in recruitment of other members of the advisory board, other 
management members, and identifying potential sources of working capital.  
The term of Mr. van Ulden's appointment would be one year.

Jeff Dasovich and I have reviewed UtilityGuide's website 
(www.utilityguide.com) and we do not believe that Mr. van Ulden's service on 
the advisory board would be in conflict with the Enron Corporate Conduct 
policy, mainly because (a) UtilityGuide as an aggregator of energy servicers 
and not an energy service provider itself does not appear to be a competitor 
of Enron, and (b) Mr. van Ulden's position at Enron Energy Services as a 
project manager under Jeff Messina's Account Management and Delivery group 
limits virtually all actual conflicts between Mr. van Ulden's duties at EES 
v. his duties at UtilityGuide.  However, because of EES' ongoing forays into 
the electronic marketplace, we thought it appropriate to ask your thoughts 
before responding.  I believe that Mr. van Ulden has the concurrence of his 
management as to this appointment, although of course we can seek concurrence 
from any other management entities deemed necessary or prudent.

Your input would be greatly appreciated.  Pls let me know if I can provide 
any further information.  I can be reached in San Ramon at 925 543 3706.  
Jeff Dasovich can be reached in San Francisco at 415 782 7822.

I don't know the answer to your 1st question since I don't recall ever
having to have insurance certificates on any of the other Facility

The Retention LC was faxed this am to Greg Lang and Isabell Parker.  Jaap's

Also, need to talk about Austin Tech reps being added to Facility Agreement

we need something in the interim that confirms this will be added into the
Austin Facility Agreement (e-mail to me OK).

Good morning.

I haven't seen the insurance certificate she references.  Anyone know where
it is?

Is the retention letter of credit available yet? I know it has been
requested, but I don't recall seeing that it has been delivered.

Thanks for everything,

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it ""reinserts"" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",365,"Dear Mr. Lay,

received an invitation to  participate?in a debate there in November  (copy 
forwarded separately). It seems that Enron is also to be invited. I have  no 
other commitments in the US at that time.? Is is something that Enron  might 
be interested in supporting, or for that matter developing  further?
?
We spoke some time ago about the Common Carriage  Consultative Working Group 
at Ofwat. I did in fact aprticipate in that, along  with Kyran Hanks. It was 
a real eye-opener, to see how little awareness there  was of the basic 
conditions conducive to competition, like separate businesses  and accounts.? 
I'm not sure whether Enron is pursuing this now or not. No  doubt lots of 
other things going on.
?
I should be interested to hear from you on retail  competition.? I am copying 
this to Mark Schroeder and Kyran.
?
With regards
?

This looks fine.   Paul Choi will again be offsetting any payments to Valley Electric, so no physical payment will be sent to them.

Just as a final cross-check to make sure we are all operating under the same understanding for Willamette, they have been paid the full amount plus an overage of $25.  They will not be receiving any additional funds on 5/31, nor will they be charged for the overage.  The amount overpaid to them will be included  in the entry for ECTstCA.  Is that your understanding as well?

Other than that, payments listed in your spreadsheet are good to go. 

Please let me know when the payments are actually released.

Hi,

The Preliminary and Final Actualizations for November 2000 ISO transactions have been completed.  A Flash file has been saved in the CALISO shared folder as ""1100 Settlements Final ISO_051701.xls.""  This file reflects the total amount of settlement, as well as the amounts to pay or invoice based on the short-pay amount that the ISO actually paid to EPMI.  This amount will be found in column G under ""New Settlement.""  The amounts in column H, ""Short Pay,"" represent the amount that we did not receive from the ISO; an accrual needs to be put in the system to account for this unpaid amount.

Please feel free to call me or Murray O'Neil if you have any questions regarding this file.

Change order 2 was initialled by Dale and signed by Chris on November 2, re 
stack extensions.  I also have a hand marked up change order form from Ed 
Danhaus referring to brush power system stabilizers.  Is this what you are 
looking for?

The procedure has been that the project team/attorney prepares the draft of 
the change order (or has EECC do it), I give it a sanity check and arrange 
for signature from GE.

The issue now would be whether this change order should be processed in the 
next week, or be a change to the break out contract.  I do not believe the

Laura, 
Please find attached the final version of the statement re the Stockholm 
meeting approved by regulatory and legal.

As we discussed and per your memo below, please send this tonight to all the 
Brussels correspondents Peter spoke to (or established a relationship with) 
in the last few months re European energy liberalisation including Patrick 
Cox of Bloomberg (today), Philip Shiskin from the WSJ last Monday and Daniel 
Dombey from the FT last week.  Peter covered most of these points already 
today in his Bloomberg interview (France and Germany in particular were not 
really touched upon).

We will also use it on a reactive basis for when correspondents contact you 
there in Brussels, us here in London, C&W in Frankfurt and GK in Oslo. Please 
let us know any enquiries you might receive before sending out the statement.

Many thanks

Eva

Sally/Mike,

I will be in Houston the week after Christmas (12/26-12/29) and was
wondering if the two of you were going to be in the office, and if so, would
you be available for lunch? In talking with David Beck, he was going to try
to arrange a golf game (Mike, me, Richard Kimberlin and David) one of those
afternoons at Champions. If that is possible, then maybe lunch before golf
might work. If not, then I can meet you downtown when convenient. Let me
know what your schedules are like and I will plan my schedule accordingly.

Also, I need to know if I need to mail the Orange Bowl tickets to both of
you separately or just one of you. Didn't know if you are planning on going
to Miami together? I should receive the tickets in the next day or two and
will do whatever. Ought to be a fun trip, as it has definitely been awhile
since the Sooners have been to Miami.

Anyway, let me know if you are available for lunch/gold or just lunch.

Hope you all have a wonderful holiday season and most of all get to spend
time with your families!

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it 
more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM 
has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar 
tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet 
(hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Subject: Re: TW Options filing  


In our pre-filing discussion, we explained the awarding of call options as 
follows:

Because call options are only sold after we have tried to sell the underlying 
capacity and there were no takers at max. rate or an acceptable price, there 
is really only 1 variable -- the total rate (consisting of the option 
component and the strike price).

The call option is posted for a specific quantity, start date, etc.  There 
are no other variables.  It's just price.

From our discussions with Mike Coleman and crew on this topic -- I think is 
it absolutely key that we keep the award variables to a minimum.  My take is 
that the transmittal letter referring to highest price is the right way to 
go.  The concept in the tariff about posting the evaluation criteria 
(implying that there are more variables) could kill the deal.",306,"To synthesize what I'm hearing from you and MKM (and Mr. Ni),  our story is

Hi. Hope things are going well for you in Europe. I was going through some old emails and ran across this one and thought I'd drop you a line. How is the family settling in and how is the job going? Things are fine here. I turned down a job with UBS and am waiting for my contract to expire. I will be glad when this whole Enron chapter is closed in my life. I'm sure everyone will. Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know how things are going for you. Take care.

<7026974.1075859920894.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Re: enrononline.com.sg,"Anna, thanks for your concern.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.

Felipe, as we discussed on the phone, try talking with netnames and see what 
they say.  I think, if it's easy to do both, then we could use the second one 
as a matter of course, but I don't think it's an issue: registering a domain 
name--a simple process, sometimes--is not the same as creating contracts and 
trading off them--a much more complicated effort.  (Cyber squatters, for 
example, aren't even the legal corporations whose domains they carry.)

Thanks for thinking about it, though!  (And if it all goes wrong I'm sending 
you and Felipe this email so we'll all know who made the mistake)

PS: If the lawyers have any objections, please make them known as soon as 
possible so we change our course of action.  Thanks!

Jay,

Singapore will be trading financial products not physical on EOL initially. 
With this in mind should we  use the second legal entity in this case?  I was 
not sure whether this was a minor detail to consider when registering the 
domain name.

Jay, 

In Singapore we have:

 Enron Capital & Trade Resources Singapore Private Limited (registration 
number 199201238C). This entity was incorporated as a private company 
(limited by shares issued to EGLI) and all physical trades of global liquids 
are entered into using this entity.   The directors of this company James 
Derrick, Michael Lynn Brown &  Lim Tiong Hock).  The company secretary is 
Matthias Lee. 
 Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp (company number  F 
05215W).  This was set up as the Singapore branch of ECTRIC  to trade in 
global liquids financials.  Agents for this company are Kevin Garrett Sweeney 
and Lim Tiong Hock.
I think it may be easier and quicker to register using (1) above but I leave 
the actual entity choice to you.

Dear Tiong

I need to know Enron's ""registered business comapny number"" in Signapore in 
order to register www.enrononline.com.sg, as well as the office's contact 
details, and Angela Connelly suggested that I contact you to obtain this 
information.

Could you supply me with this information?

Thanks in advance

Thanks for the reply.  Your thoughts on the EEI draft in terms of details would be helpful.  As I read it, we still have the problems with the EEI draft that we had with the NERC draft on which it is based -- deference, regional rules variances, regional reliability entities, regional advisory boards, limits on FERC authority, etc., etc.  It would also be helpful to have input on whether the plans for EISB could go forward if legislation like the EEI bill were enacted into law.  It would seem not since the ""SRO"" would focus only on ""reliability"" as defined by how the bill defines what matters are subjects for an ""organization standard.""

Subject:	RE: EPSA/EEI on Reliability

I guess the point of debate is what is meant by ""self-regulating"" ?  Can we live with such a name in the language - as long as the language has all the hooks to FERC and other regulators? ( No deference, etc.)  If the language is there that we want - then from the other guys' side, what do THEY see left in the name ""self-regulating""?  I think we need to understand this before we can be comfortable with any type of support for ""SRO"".

Subject:	EPSA/EEI on Reliability


This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability.  Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.

I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC ""consensus""), but I think EPSA staff may be ""too flexible"" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.

It is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can.  I will check with some other EPSA members.

you certainly realize that you must provide the FERC with summary notes
of meetings with groups, agencies, etc. when we make the FERC filing -

Kevin and Eric,
Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a
little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in
the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the
landowners stirred up before we are ready.  What are your thoughts?  Are
you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a
preliminary route?  John

In discussions with several agency personnel, it ""appears"" as though
they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as
confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can
discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like ""I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better.""
Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott
